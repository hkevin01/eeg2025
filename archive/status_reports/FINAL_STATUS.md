## 🔍 Analysis

### What Worked Excellently ✅
1. **VS Code optimization** - Completely eliminated crashes
2. **CPU training** - Stable and fast enough for this scale
3. **Transfer learning** - Reduced Challenge 1 training to 5 minutes
4. **Modular scripts** - Easy to understand and modify
5. **Automatic workflows** - Checkpointing and submission generation

### What Needs Improvement ⚠️
1. **Challenge 1 performance** (Pearson r = 0.06 vs target 0.3)
   - Reason: Used random age labels for demo
   - Fix: Need real age labels from participants.tsv
2. **Dataset size** (used 5K vs 38K available)
   - Reason: Quick validation
   - Fix: Train on full dataset for better performance
3. **Training duration** (limited to 5 epochs)
   - Reason: Time constraint
   - Fix: Train longer for better convergence

## 💡 Key Learnings

### System Optimization
1. **Python linters are resource hogs** during ML training
   - Pylance alone: 125%+ CPU
   - Combined: 400%+ CPU overhead
   - Solution: Disable during intensive tasks

2. **VS Code needs project-specific settings** for ML
   - File watching overhead significant
   - Auto-save can cause issues
   - Terminal scrollback limits help

3. **Process monitoring essential**
   - Multiple training processes cause conflicts
   - Monitor and kill duplicates
   - Use proper background process management

### Machine Learning
1. **Transfer learning highly effective**
   - Reduced params from 176K to 4K trainable
   - Training time: 5 min vs hours
   - Still achieves learning (loss decreased)

2. **CPU training viable** for prototyping
   - No GPU compatibility issues
   - Stable and predictable
   - Good for development/testing

3. **Small datasets for rapid iteration**
   - 5K samples trains in 28 minutes
   - Good for pipeline validation
   - Scale up after confirming workflow

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

### Short Term (< 1 hour)
```bash
# 1. Get real age labels

# 2. Train Challenge 1 on full dataset
# Edit train_challenge1_simple.py: remove [:2000] limit
python3 scripts/train_challenge1_simple.py

# 3. Implement Challenge 2 (sex classification)

```bash
# 4. Train foundation model on full dataset
python3 scripts/train_simple.py  # Uses all 38K samples

# 5. Re-run challenges with better foundation model
python3 scripts/train_challenge1_simple.py
python3 scripts/train_challenge2_simple.py
```

### Long Term (1+ days)
```bash
# 6. Hyperparameter tuning
# 7. Progressive unfreezing experiments
# 8. Ensemble methods
# 9. Submit to competition
# 10. Monitor leaderboard
```
