🚀 GPU Training with Timeout Protection
==================================================

🔧 Step 2: Safe GPU check (with timeout)...
   Testing GPU availability...
   GPU detected: AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT
   Testing small tensor operation...
   ⚠️  GPU test timed out after 15s - killing process

⚠️  Using CPU for training
   Reason: GPU test timeout

🏋️  Training on CPU...

📊 Loading minimal dataset...
   Using 10 samples

🧠 Creating model on cpu...

🚀 Training for 2 epochs...
