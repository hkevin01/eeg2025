## üéì Key Talking Points

### What I've Accomplished
1. ‚úÖ **Built working baseline** (1.32 NRMSE - competitive!)
2. ‚úÖ **Integrated competition infrastructure** (starter kit, metrics)
3. ‚úÖ **Learned from failures** (TCN taught valuable lessons)
4. ‚úÖ **Created ready improvements** (TTA ready, attention in development)
5. ‚úÖ **Comprehensive documentation** (all work tracked and explained)

### What I Understand About ML/AI
- **CNNs:** How they work (filters detecting patterns layer-by-layer)
- **Overfitting:** Why it happens and how to prevent it
- **Regularization:** Dropout, batch normalization, data augmentation
- **Metrics:** NRMSE and what the scores mean
- **Training:** Loss functions, optimizers, learning rates

### Current Capabilities
```
‚úÖ Load and preprocess EEG data
‚úÖ Train CNN models from scratch
‚úÖ Evaluate using official metrics
‚úÖ Debug and analyze failures
‚úÖ Create competition submissions
‚úÖ Integrate advanced techniques (TTA, attention)
```

## üìä Decision Points for Team

### 1. Should we submit TTA version now?

**Option A: Submit Now (Conservative)**
```
Pros:
- Secure 10% improvement (1.32 ‚Üí 1.20)
- Low risk, proven technique
- Get feedback quickly

Cons:
- Uses up a submission
- Might want to combine with other improvements
```

**Option B: Wait for Attention Model (Aggressive)**
```
Pros:
- Potentially bigger improvement (‚Üí 1.00)
- One submission with multiple improvements
- More impactful

Cons:
- Attention might not work
- Takes more time to train
- Higher risk
```

**My Recommendation:** Submit TTA now to secure improvement, train attention in parallel.

### 2. What should we prioritize?

**High Priority (Do First):**
- ‚úÖ Submit TTA submission (secure baseline improvement)
- ‚è≥ Complete attention model training
- ‚è≥ Validate attention on test data

**Medium Priority (If Time):**
- Ensemble methods (combine multiple models)
- More aggressive data augmentation
- Hyperparameter optimization

**Low Priority (Nice to Have):**
- Transfer learning from other datasets
- Different architectures (transformers, GNNs)
- Advanced regularization techniques

### 3. What resources do we need?

**Compute:**
- Current: CPU training (slow but works)
- Need: GPU access for faster iteration?

**Data:**
- Current: Using HBN dataset (R1-R5)
- Need: Additional datasets for pre-training?

**Team:**
- Current: Solo work
- Need: More team members? Specialized expertise?

**Time:**
- Need: Realistic timeline to deadline
- Need: Submission quota status

## üöÄ Proposed Action Plan

### Week 1 (This Week)
**Monday:**
- [ ] Team meeting and decision on strategy
- [ ] Submit TTA if approved

**Tuesday-Wednesday:**
- [ ] Complete attention model training
- [ ] Validate on test set

**Thursday-Friday:**

## üé§ Opening Statement (Suggestion)

*"Thanks everyone for joining. I've been working on the EEG Foundation Model Challenge for the past week. I've built a working baseline that scores 1.32 NRMSE - which is competitive. I've learned a lot about CNNs, overfitting, and what works vs what doesn't.*

*I have two improvements ready:*
1. *Test-Time Augmentation - ready to submit now, expect 10% improvement*
2. *Attention model - in development, could get us to sub-1.0*

*I've prepared comprehensive documentation covering everything I've tried and why. Today I'd like to:*
1. *Walk through what I've built*
2. *Explain the technical approach*
3. *Discuss strategy going forward*
4. *Decide next steps*

*Let's start with the quick reference, then dive into questions."*
