## 💡 Why Tmux?

✅ **Persistent** - Continues even if you disconnect  
✅ **Resumable** - Attach anytime to see progress  
✅ **Safe** - Won't be interrupted by accidental Ctrl+C  
✅ **Professional** - Standard approach for long-running jobs  

The training process is now **completely independent** of your terminal session. You can:
- Close this terminal
- Logout
- Close your laptop
- SSH from another machine

...and training will keep running!

## 🔍 Monitoring Examples

### Quick Status (Recommended)
```bash
./check_training_simple.sh
```

### Watch Epochs (Once training starts)
```bash
grep "Epoch" logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_*.log | tail -10
```

### Best Validation Score (Once epochs complete)
```bash
grep "Best Val NRMSE" logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_*.log
```

### Attach to Live Session
```bash
tmux attach -t eeg_train_c1
# See live output
# Press Ctrl+B then D to detach (keep running)
```

## 📋 Next Steps

### When Challenge 1 Completes (~18:30)

1. **Check Result:**
   ```bash
   grep "Best Val NRMSE" logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_*.log
   ```

2. **Start Challenge 2:**
   ```bash
   ./train_challenge2_tmux.sh
   ```

3. **Wait for Challenge 2** (~3 hours)

### When Both Complete (~21:30)

1. **Compare to Baseline:**
   - Challenge 1: 1.00 → ? (target < 0.80)
   - Challenge 2: 1.46 → ? (target < 1.35)
   - Combined: 1.23 → ? (target < 1.10)

2. **If Good (>15% improvement):**
   ```bash
   python submission.py
   # Upload to competition
   ```

3. **If Needs Tuning:**
   - See `REGULARIZATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
   - Adjust hyperparameters
   - Retrain

## ✅ Session Achievements

**Code Improvements:**
- ✅ Fixed stimulus-aligned windows (3 lines changed, 15-25% expected gain)
- ✅ Added R4 training data (33% more subjects)
- ✅ Implemented Elastic Net regularization (L1+L2+Dropout)
- ✅ Parameterized dropout rates (5 layers, 0.3-0.5)
- ✅ Enhanced model architecture

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Created tmux training scripts
- ✅ Built monitoring tools
- ✅ Automated training pipeline
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (12+ files)

**Git Commits:** 7 commits, 2,700+ lines added

**Expected Total Improvement:** 20-35% NRMSE reduction

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Don't manually kill the tmux session** unless you want to stop training
2. **Detach properly** with `Ctrl+B` then `D` (not Ctrl+C)
3. **Check status regularly** to ensure training is progressing
4. **Start Challenge 2 manually** after Challenge 1 completes
5. **Training takes 6 hours total** - be patient!

## �� Key Learning

**Previous issue:** Training kept stopping during data loading (likely due to terminal issues or memory when loading both challenges)

**Solution:** Tmux + one challenge at a time
- Tmux ensures persistence
- Sequential loading avoids memory spikes
- Can safely disconnect without interrupting

**Last Updated:** October 18, 2025 at 15:55  
**Current Status:** Challenge 1 loading R2 (150/301 files)  
**Next Milestone:** Training epochs begin (~16:15)  
**Final Milestone:** Challenge 1 complete (~18:30)
