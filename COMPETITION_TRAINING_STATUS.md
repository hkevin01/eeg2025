## 📊 Competition Alignment

### ✅ What We're Doing Right

1. **Using Official Competition Data**
   - Training on R1, R2, R3 releases
   - Validating on R4 release
   - Using `EEGChallengeDataset` from starter kit
   - Task: `contrastChangeDetection` (Challenge 1)

2. **Proper Data Processing**
   - Using official preprocessing pipeline
   - `annotate_trials_with_target` for response times
   - `create_windows_from_events` for trial extraction
   - Proper window sizing (2.0s epochs)

3. **Competition Format**
   - Output: Response time predictions (Challenge 1)
   - Metric: NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error)
   - Will integrate into submission.py

4. **Robust Training**
   - Crash-proof (nohup + background)
   - Auto-checkpointing every 5 epochs
   - Early stopping (patience=15)
   - Gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0)

## 🔍 How to Monitor

### Option 1: Use Enhanced Monitor (Recommended)
```bash
./scripts/monitoring/monitor_training_enhanced.sh
```
Shows:
- Real-time training progress
- GPU/CPU utilization
- Epoch progress with ETA
- Loss curves
- All challenges at once

### Option 2: Use Basic Monitor
```bash
./scripts/monitor_training.sh
```

### Option 3: Watch Log Directly
```bash
tail -f logs/train_real_20251017_182023.log
```

### Option 4: Check Process Status
```bash
ps aux | grep train_tcn_competition
```

## 📈 Expected Timeline

### Current Phase: Data Loading & Initial Epochs
- **Data Loading:** 5-15 minutes (processing R1-R4 releases)
- **Per Epoch:** ~30-60 seconds (depends on data size)
- **Total Epochs:** Up to 100 (with early stopping)
- **Expected Duration:** 1-3 hours

### Next Steps
1. ⏳ **Wait for training to complete** (1-3 hours)
2. ✅ **Evaluate best model** on validation set
3. 🔧 **Integrate into submission.py** (replace current model)
4. 🧪 **Test submission** locally
5. 📦 **Create submission ZIP** with new weights
6. 🚀 **Upload to Codabench** competition platform

## 🔥 Key Improvements Over Previous Training

### What Changed
1. **Data Source:** Now using actual competition data (R1-R5) instead of generic HBN BDF files
2. **Task Focus:** Specifically `contrastChangeDetection` for Challenge 1
3. **Proper Preprocessing:** Using official starter kit methods
4. **Competition Format:** EEGChallengeDataset with proper release structure
5. **Response Time Extraction:** Proper annotation with `annotate_trials_with_target`

### Why This Matters
- Previous training used generic EEG data (any task)
- Now training on exact competition task
- Proper release structure (R1-R5)
- Will generalize better to test set (R5)
- Can be validated on R12 leaderboard
