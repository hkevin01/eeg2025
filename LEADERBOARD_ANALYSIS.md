## Critical Insights

### 1. Challenge 2 is the Bottleneck ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Leaders:** 0.99893 - 1.00802 (very tight!)
- **Our baseline:** 1.46 (47% worse than leader!)
- **Our target:** 1.20-1.30 (still 20-30% behind)

**Challenge 2 requires major improvement** to be competitive.

### 2. Challenge 1 Has Potential ‚úÖ
- **Leaders:** 0.92793 - 0.94989
- **Our baseline:** 1.00 (only 7-8% behind)
- **Our target:** 0.65-0.75 (could beat all current leaders!)

Our stimulus alignment fix could make Challenge 1 competitive!

### 3. Competition is Tight at the Top
- Gap between 2nd and 5th: only **0.00232** (0.2%!)
- Small improvements matter
- Both challenges need to be strong

## What This Means for Us

### Current Training Goals

**Challenge 1 (Stimulus-Aligned):**
- ‚úÖ Good potential with our improvements
- Target: 0.65-0.75 NRMSE
- If we hit 0.70: **Competitive with top 3**
- If we hit 0.65: **Could be #1 on Challenge 1**

**Challenge 2 (Behavior Prediction):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Major concern - we're far behind
- Baseline: 1.46 vs competition 0.99-1.01
- Target: 1.20-1.30 (still behind)
- **Needs much more work than just regularization**

### Revised Success Criteria

**Minimum Success:**
- Challenge 1: < 0.85 NRMSE (15% improvement)
- Challenge 2: < 1.30 NRMSE (11% improvement)
- Combined: < 1.10 NRMSE (11% improvement)
- Result: Still behind leaders, but progress

**Competitive Success:**
- Challenge 1: < 0.75 NRMSE (25% improvement)
- Challenge 2: < 1.10 NRMSE (25% improvement)
- Combined: < 0.93 NRMSE (24% improvement)
- Result: **Potentially top 5**

**Victory Success:**
- Challenge 1: < 0.70 NRMSE (30% improvement)
- Challenge 2: < 1.00 NRMSE (32% improvement)
- Combined: < 0.85 NRMSE (31% improvement)
- Result: **Potentially #1**

## Action Plan Based on Leaderboard

### Phase 1: Complete Current Training ‚úÖ
- Let Challenge 1 finish (stimulus-aligned, R4 data, regularization)
- Let Challenge 2 finish (R4 data, regularization)
- **Expected:** Moderate improvement, still behind leaders

### Phase 2: Analyze Current Training Results
When training completes (~21:30):

**If Challenge 1 < 0.75:**
- ‚úÖ Stimulus alignment worked!
- Submit and move to Challenge 2 improvements

**If Challenge 1 > 0.85:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need more improvements
- Try attention mechanisms (TRAINING_IMPROVEMENTS_TODO.md)

**If Challenge 2 < 1.10:**
- ‚úÖ Better than expected!
- Submit immediately

**If Challenge 2 > 1.30:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Major issue
- Challenge 2 needs deep investigation

### Phase 3: Challenge 2 Deep Dive (Priority!)

**Challenge 2 is our weak spot.** After current training, we should:

1. **Investigate Challenge 2 Baseline**
   ```bash
   # Check what's different about Challenge 2
   # - Different task (behavior vs RT)
   # - Different data distribution?
   # - Different optimal architecture?
   ```

2. **Potential Challenge 2 Improvements:**
   - **More data augmentation** (temporal, spatial)
   - **Better architecture** (maybe needs different model than Challenge 1)
   - **Ensemble methods** (combine multiple models)
   - **Better preprocessing** (check for artifacts)
   - **Task-specific features** (behavior patterns)

3. **Study Competition Winners:**
   - What did ayana do? (0.92793 C1, 1.00802 C2)
   - What did orangejuicy do? (0.94989 C1, 0.99893 C2)
   - Pattern: Strong on both challenges, but especially C2

### Phase 4: Advanced Methods (If Needed)

From TRAINING_IMPROVEMENTS_TODO.md:
1. **Attention mechanisms** (15-20% potential)
2. **Multi-scale temporal** (10-15% potential)
3. **Transfer learning** (10-15% potential)
4. **Ensemble methods** (5-10% potential)

- Challenge 2: 1.20-1.30 NRMSE ‚Üí **Still behind on C2**
- Combined: 1.00-1.05 NRMSE ‚Üí **Not top 5 yet**

**Worst Case (Minimal improvement):**
- Challenge 1: 0.85-0.90 NRMSE ‚Üí **Behind leaders**
- Challenge 2: 1.35-1.40 NRMSE ‚Üí **Far behind**
- Combined: 1.10-1.15 NRMSE ‚Üí **Need major rework**

## Recommendations

### Immediate (During Training)
1. ‚úÖ Let training complete
2. üìä Monitor progress
3. üìã Prepare Challenge 2 investigation

### After Training (~21:30)
1. **Check Challenge 1 results first**
   - If < 0.75: Great! Stimulus alignment worked
   - If > 0.85: Need more work

2. **Check Challenge 2 results**
   - If < 1.10: Better than expected, submit!
   - If > 1.30: Deep dive needed

3. **Compare to competition**
   - Are we top 5?
   - What's the gap?
   - Where to focus next?

### Next Session
1. **Focus on Challenge 2** (biggest gap)
2. **Try advanced methods** (attention, multi-scale)
3. **Consider ensemble** (combine multiple approaches)
4. **Study competition patterns** (what are winners doing?)
