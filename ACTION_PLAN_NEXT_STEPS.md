# 🎯 Action Plan & Next Steps - October 30, 2025

## ✅ Completed Work (Last 2 Hours)

### 1. Root Cause Investigation ✅
- **Problem**: All retraining produced Val Loss 0.16 (2x worse than V8's 0.079)
- **Investigation**: Compared `train_c1_tonight.py` (V8) vs `train_c1_ensemble.py`
- **Root Cause**: **Missing mixup augmentation** in ensemble training
- **Evidence**: 
  - V8 used `mixup_alpha=0.2`
  - Ensemble script had no mixup implementation
  - Mixup is critical for preventing overfitting

### 2. TTA Experiment ✅
- **Implementation**: Created V8+TTA with 5 augmentations
- **Test**: Evaluated on 100 validation samples
- **Results**: **0.00% improvement** (MSE 0.098634 for both)
- **Conclusion**: TTA provides no benefit, don't use

### 3. Fix Applied & Training Started ✅
- **Fix**: Added mixup augmentation to `train_c1_ensemble.py`
- **Training**: Started tmux session at 17:55
- **Status**: Running (305% CPU, 4.5GB RAM)
- **Expected**: First checkpoint in ~10-15 minutes

## 📊 Current Status (17:58)

```
✅ Investigation complete    - Root cause: missing mixup
✅ TTA tested               - 0% improvement, discard
✅ Fix implemented          - Mixup added to ensemble
🔄 Training running         - Seed 42, loading data phase
⏳ Waiting                  - First checkpoint expected ~18:05-18:10
```

### Training Process Details
- **Session**: `tmux attach -t c1_ensemble_fixed`
- **Log file**: `training_ensemble_fixed.log` (buffered, no output yet)
- **Process**: PID 670639, 305% CPU, 4.5GB RAM
- **Phase**: Loading and preprocessing data

## 🎯 Decision Tree

### Checkpoint 1: First Validation (18:05-18:10)

```
Check Val Loss after first model completes:

├─ Val Loss < 0.085 (Good!)
│  ├─ Continue all 5 seeds (30-40 more minutes)
│  └─ Then proceed to Checkpoint 2
│
├─ Val Loss 0.085-0.095 (Acceptable)
│  ├─ Continue all 5 seeds
│  └─ May still get small improvement from averaging
│
├─ Val Loss > 0.095 (Still worse)
│  ├─ STOP training
│  ├─ Submit V8 immediately
│  └─ Mixup alone wasn't enough
```

### Checkpoint 2: Ensemble Complete (if proceeding)

```
After all 5 seeds finish:

├─ Create ensemble predictions
│  └─ Average predictions from 5 models
│
├─ Test on validation set
│  ├─ Compare to V8 (0.079314)
│  └─ Calculate improvement %
│
├─ Decision:
│  ├─ If better: Create phase1_v9, submit ensemble
│  └─ If worse/same: Submit V8
```

## ⏰ Timeline Options

### Option A: Wait for Ensemble (Recommended if first checkpoint good)
**Time**: 18:00 - 19:00 (60 minutes)
- 18:05-18:10: Check first seed Val Loss
- 18:10-18:45: Continue all 5 seeds (if good)
- 18:45-18:50: Create ensemble, test
- 18:50-19:00: Package and submit

**Pros**:
- Potential 1-3% improvement
- Ensemble more robust
- Worth the wait if working

**Cons**:
- 60 minute wait
- May not improve over V8
- Risk of bugs in ensemble code

**Triggers to STOP and submit V8**:
- First seed Val Loss > 0.095
- Any seed diverges or NaN
- Time reaches 18:30 with no progress

### Option B: Submit V8 Now (Conservative)
**Time**: Immediate (5 minutes)
- Package V8 submission
- Upload to competition
- Focus on C2 instead

**Pros**:
- V8 is proven (1.0002)
- No risk of regression
- Can work on C2 (43x more room)

**Cons**:
- Miss potential 1-3% from ensemble
- Only 0.0002 from perfect score

### Option C: Work on C2 (Highest Expected Value)
**Time**: 18:00 - 20:00 (2 hours)
- C2 current: 1.0087
- C2 target: 1.00
- 87x more error than C1 (0.0087 vs 0.0002)

**Why C2 has more potential**:
- Challenge 2 is TCN-based (different architecture space)
- Validation MSE: 0.006-0.008 range
- More room for optimization
- Could improve overall score more

## 🎲 Expected Value Analysis

| Action | Time | Expected Gain | Success Prob | EV (gain * prob) |
|--------|------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| Wait for ensemble | 60 min | -0.00003 (C1) | 30% | -0.000009 |
| Submit V8, work C2 | 120 min | -0.0010 (C2) | 50% | -0.0005 |
| Just submit V8 | 5 min | 0 (safe) | 100% | 0 |

**Math**:
- C1 improvement: 1.0002 → 0.9999 = -0.0003 score change
- C2 improvement: 1.0087 → 1.0070 = -0.0017 score change
- Overall = (C1 + C2) / 2

**Recommendation**: If ensemble first checkpoint looks good (Val Loss < 0.085), continue. Otherwise, pivot to C2.

## 📝 Commands Reference

### Monitor Training
```bash
# Check tmux session
tmux attach -t c1_ensemble_fixed

# Check log file (when it starts writing)
tail -f training_ensemble_fixed.log

# Check process
ps aux | grep train_c1_ensemble

# Get last few lines of log
tail -20 training_ensemble_fixed.log
```

### If Need to Stop Training
```bash
# Kill tmux session
tmux kill-session -t c1_ensemble_fixed
```

### Package Submission (when ready)

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Primary Path** (chosen by you earlier):
1. ✅ **Investigation complete** - Found missing mixup
2. ✅ **TTA tested** - No benefit
3. 🔄 **Training running** - Waiting for first checkpoint
4. ⏳ **Decision point**: 18:05-18:10 when first Val Loss available

**If first Val Loss < 0.085**: Continue to full ensemble
**If first Val Loss > 0.095**: Stop, submit V8, optionally work on C2

**Deadline**: Competition ends Nov 3 (3 days remaining)

**Target Goals**:
- Challenge 1: < 1.0000 (would need ensemble to beat V8)

- Overall: < 1.0050 (1.1 points improvement)

**Stretch Goals**:
- Challenge 1: 0.91 (aspirational, likely unreachable)
