# Multi-Release Training Implementation

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Severe Overfitting to Release 5:**
- **Validation (R5):** Challenge 1: 0.47, Challenge 2: 0.08
- **Test (R12):** Challenge 1: 4.05, Challenge 2: 1.14  
- **Degradation:** 10x and 14x worse on test set!

**Root Cause:** Models trained only on Release 5, but tested on Release 12

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Data Strategy
- **Train on:** R1, R2, R3, R4 (240 datasets)
- **Validate on:** R5 (60 datasets)
- **All releases verified accessible!**

### Model Improvements

#### Challenge 1: 800K → 200K params, dropout 0.5, weight decay 1e-4
#### Challenge 2: 600K → 150K params, dropout 0.5, weight decay 1e-4

### Expected Results
- **Current overall:** 2.01 NRMSE (5th place)
- **Expected overall:** ~0.70 NRMSE (top 3 potential!)
- **Improvement:** 65% error reduction
