## 🚀 TRAINING IMPROVEMENT IDEAS (IF NEEDED)

### Short-Term (1-3 days)

#### 1. Ensemble Methods
```
Strategy: Train multiple models, average predictions
├─ Different random seeds (5 models)

└─ Expected gain: 10-15%

Implementation:
1. Train 5 models with different seeds
2. Save all models
3. Average predictions at inference

Time: 1-2 days
```

#### 2. Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)
```
Strategy: Augment at inference time, average predictions
├─ Gaussian noise variations (5-10 versions)
├─ Temporal jitter variations
├─ Channel dropout variations
└─ Expected gain: 5-10%

Implementation:
1. Create multiple augmented versions
2. Run inference on each
3. Average predictions
4. Minimal code changes

Time: 4-6 hours
```

#### 3. Hyperparameter Optimization
```
Strategy: Use Optuna for automated search
Parameters to optimize:
├─ Learning rate: [1e-5, 1e-3]
├─ Dropout rates: [0.1, 0.5]
├─ Attention heads: [4, 8, 16]
├─ Hidden dims: [64, 128, 256]
└─ Expected gain: 5-10%

Implementation:
1. Set up Optuna study
2. Run 50-100 trials
3. Select best configuration
4. Retrain with best params

Time: 2-3 days
```

### Medium-Term (3-7 days)

#### 4. Advanced Feature Engineering
```
EEG-Specific Features:
├─ P300 event-related potentials
├─ Frequency band power (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
├─ Cross-frequency coupling
├─ Topographic map features
└─ Expected gain: 15-20%

Implementation:
1. Extract frequency features (MNE-Python)
2. Concatenate with raw EEG
3. Update model input dimension
4. Retrain models

Time: 3-5 days
```

#### 5. Domain Adaptation Techniques
```
Strategy: Make features release-invariant
Methods:
├─ Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN)
├─ Gradient reversal layer
├─ Release-invariant feature learning
└─ Expected gain: 10-20%

Implementation:
1. Add domain classifier
2. Gradient reversal layer
3. Train to confuse domain classifier
4. Release-invariant features

Time: 4-6 days
```

#### 6. Transformer Architecture
```
Strategy: Vision Transformer for EEG
Architecture:
├─ Patch embedding for EEG segments
├─ Multi-head self-attention
├─ Position embeddings
├─ Feed-forward network
└─ Expected gain: 20-30%

Implementation:
1. Implement EEG Transformer
2. Train from scratch or pretrain
3. Compare with current best
4. Ensemble if better

Time: 5-7 days
```
