**System crashes during training:**
- VS Code would crash and freeze the entire PC
- Happened when training Challenge 2 with R1-R4 data
- System became unresponsive, required hard reboot

## Root Cause

**Memory Overflow:**
```
R1-R4 datasets = 719 subjects
Loading all into RAM = 40-50GB required
System RAM available = 31.3GB
Result: CRASH ☠️
```
