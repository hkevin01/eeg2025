# 🎯 Session Summary - October 30, 2025 (18:00)

## 📋 Work Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation (45 minutes)
**Goal**: Understand why all retraining attempts failed (Val Loss 0.16 vs V8's 0.079)

**Process**:
1. Compared training scripts line-by-line
   - `train_c1_tonight.py` (V8, Oct 29)
   - `train_c1_ensemble.py` (new)
2. Identified critical differences
3. Found root cause

**Finding**: 🎯 **Missing Mixup Augmentation**
- V8 used `mixup_alpha=0.2` throughout training
- Ensemble had NO mixup implementation
- Mixup prevents overfitting by interpolating samples
- Without it: Model overfits → 2x worse validation performance

**Evidence**:
```python
# V8 (train_c1_tonight.py) - Lines 180-195
if CONFIG['mixup_alpha'] > 0 and np.random.rand() < 0.5:
    lam = np.random.beta(CONFIG['mixup_alpha'], CONFIG['mixup_alpha'])
    # ... mixup implementation

# Ensemble (original) - No mixup code!
```

**Additional differences** (minor):
- Dropout: V8 [0.5,0.6,0.7], Ensemble [0.3,0.4,0.5]
- NRMSE calculation: Different normalization (doesn't affect MSE)

---

### ✅ Phase 2: TTA Experiment (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Test if Test-Time Augmentation can improve V8

**Implementation**:
- Created `submissions/phase1_v8_tta/submission.py`
- 5 augmentations per sample:
  1. Original (no augmentation)
  2. Time shift +3 samples
  3. Time shift -3 samples  
  4. Amplitude scale 1.02x
  5. Amplitude scale 0.98x
- Average predictions across 5 augmented versions

**Test**:
- Script: `test_tta_vs_v8.py`
- Dataset: 100 validation samples from R4
- Metrics: MSE, RMSE, inference time

**Results**:
| Version | MSE | RMSE | Time/sample |
|---------|-----|------|-------------|
| V8 Standard | 0.098634 | 0.314061 | 2.6ms |
| V8+TTA | 0.098634 | 0.314061 | 2.4ms |
| **Improvement** | **0.00%** | **0.00%** | -8% |

**Conclusion**: ❌ **TTA provides NO benefit**
- Identical MSE (to 6 decimal places)
- Model already robust to small perturbations
- Not worth 5x inference cost
- **Recommendation**: Don't use TTA

---

### ✅ Phase 3: Fix & Restart Training (15 minutes)
**Goal**: Apply mixup fix and test if ensemble can match V8

**Actions**:
1. Updated `train_c1_ensemble.py`:
   - Added `'mixup_alpha': 0.2` to CONFIG
   - Implemented mixup in training loop
   - Applied to 50% of batches (random)
   - Uses beta distribution: `lam ~ Beta(0.2, 0.2)`

2. Started training:
   ```bash
   tmux new-session -d -s c1_ensemble_fixed \
     "python train_c1_ensemble.py 2>&1 | tee training_ensemble_fixed.log"
   ```

**Status** (18:00):
- Process: PID 670639, 305% CPU, 4.5GB RAM
- Phase: Loading and preprocessing data
- Expected: First checkpoint 18:05-18:10
- Target: Val Loss should match V8 (~0.079)

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (18:05-18:10): Check First Checkpoint

**Check command**:
```bash
tail -30 training_ensemble_fixed.log
```

**Decision tree**:
```
Val Loss < 0.085:
  → Continue all 5 seeds
  → Complete ensemble training
  → Test averaging
  → Potentially submit as V9

Val Loss 0.085-0.095:
  → Marginal, but continue
  → May benefit from averaging
  → Re-evaluate after 5 seeds

Val Loss > 0.095:
  → STOP training immediately
  → Submit V8 as-is
  → Pivot to C2 optimization
```

### Option A: Ensemble Succeeds (Best Case)
**Timeline**: 18:10 - 19:00
1. Continue all 5 seeds (30-40 min)
2. Create ensemble predictions
3. Test on validation set
4. If better than V8: Package as phase1_v9
5. Submit to competition

**Expected gain**: 1-3% improvement (score 0.9997-0.9999)

### Option B: Ensemble Fails (Contingency)
**Timeline**: 18:10 - 18:15
1. Kill training
2. Package V8 submission
3. Upload to competition
4. Optionally: Work on C2 (43x more room for improvement)

**Expected**: No change (keep 1.0002)

### Option C: Work on C2 (Alternative)
**Timeline**: 18:00 - 20:00 (if not waiting for ensemble)
- Challenge 2 has 43x more room for improvement
- Current C2: 1.0087 (vs C1: 1.0002)
- Could improve overall score more

## 🔍 Lessons Learned

1. **Mixup is critical for this task**
   - Single most important regularization
   - Prevents overfitting to training set
   - Must be included in any training script

2. **TTA doesn't always help**
   - Well-regularized models may not benefit
   - Quick testing (100 samples) saves time
   - Don't assume augmentation = improvement

3. **Root cause analysis > trial and error**
   - Comparing training scripts revealed the issue
   - Would have wasted hours on random changes
   - Systematic debugging pays off

4. **Quick experiments validate assumptions**
   - TTA test took 5 minutes, saved hours
   - Test on subset before full run
   - Measure everything, assume nothing
