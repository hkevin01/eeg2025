# üîç Investigation: Submission 87 Challenge 2 Success

## Score Achieved
**Challenge 2: 1.00867** (30.9% improvement over Oct 16's 1.460)

---

## What We Know

### Recent C2 Weights Found
```
Oct 23 20:57: weights/challenge2/weights_challenge_2_existing.pt (256K)
Oct 23 20:49: weights/challenge2/weights_challenge_2.pt (758K) ‚≠ê LIKELY THIS ONE
Oct 19 13:00: weights/challenge2/weights_challenge_2_20251019_145301.pt (261K)
Oct 16 16:22: weights/challenge_2_multi_release.pt (262K) - OLD BASELINE
```

### Most Likely Model
**weights/challenge2/weights_challenge_2.pt (758K, Oct 23 20:49)**
- Larger size (758K vs 256-262K) suggests different architecture or more training
- Created Oct 23, submitted Oct 24 16:02 - timeline matches
- This is probably what gave us 1.00867 score

### Current submission.py Uses
```python
weights_path = resolve_path('weights_challenge_2.pt')
```
This matches the file found! So we already have the winning C2 model in place.

## Strategy: Preserve the Win

### Immediate Actions

1. **Backup the Winning C2 Model** ‚úÖ
```bash
# Create backup of Oct 23 C2 weights
cp weights/challenge2/weights_challenge_2.pt weights/challenge2/weights_c2_submit87_backup.pt
cp weights/challenge2/weights_challenge_2.pt weights_challenge_2_oct23_1.00867.pt
```

2. **Document the Model** üìù
- Size: 758K (larger than typical EEGNeX ~250K)
- Date: Oct 23, 2025 20:49 UTC
- Score: 1.00867 (Submit 87)
- Status: ‚úÖ PRESERVE - Best C2 model so far

3. **Keep Using It** üéØ
- submission.py already loads 'weights_challenge_2.pt'
- This is the right model
- Don't change it!

---

## Hybrid Strategy for Next Submission

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ C2 Model: weights_challenge_2.pt (score: 1.00867) - **KEEP THIS**
- üîÑ C1 Model: Training SAM version now - **REPLACE WHEN READY**

### Plan
```
Next Submission Package:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ submission.py (current version - already correct!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ weights_challenge_1.pt (‚Üê USE NEW SAM-trained model when ready)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ weights_challenge_2.pt (‚Üê KEEP Oct 23 model, score 1.00867)

Expected Scores:
- C1: < 1.0 (from SAM training, target 0.8-0.9)
- C2: ~1.00867 (keep current)
- Overall: < 1.0 (major improvement!)
```

## What Made C2 So Good?

### Hypothesis 1: Better Architecture
- 758K size vs typical 256K EEGNeX
- Possibly deeper or wider network
- More parameters = more capacity

### Hypothesis 2: Better Training
- Trained Oct 23 (recent, after infrastructure upgrades)
- May have used HDF5 cache (faster iterations)
- Possible more epochs or better hyperparameters

### Hypothesis 3: Better Data
- Multi-release training (R1-R5)
- Better augmentation
- Subject-level CV

### To Investigate (After C1 Training Completes)
```bash
# Check if there's a training script from Oct 23
ls -lt train_challenge*py | head -10

# Check logs from Oct 23
ls -lt logs/*Oct23* 2>/dev/null || ls -lt logs/*20251023* 2>/dev/null

# Check git history
git log --since="2025-10-23 00:00" --until="2025-10-23 23:59" --oneline

# Load and inspect the model
python -c "
import torch
weights = torch.load('weights/challenge2/weights_challenge_2.pt')
print('Keys:', weights.keys())
if 'model_state_dict' in weights:
    state = weights['model_state_dict']
else:
    state = weights
print('Num params:', sum(p.numel() for p in state.values()))
print('Layers:', list(state.keys())[:10])
"
```

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Preserve Success ‚úÖ
- [x] Identify winning C2 model (weights_challenge_2.pt)
- [x] Document score (1.00867)
- [ ] Create backups
- [ ] Test model loads correctly

### Phase 2: Combine with C1 (Tonight/Tomorrow)
- [ ] Wait for SAM C1 training to complete
- [ ] Validate C1 model (target < 1.0)
- [ ] Copy SAM model to weights_challenge_1.pt
- [ ] Keep C2 model unchanged (weights_challenge_2.pt)
- [ ] Test combined submission locally
- [ ] Submit to Codabench

### Phase 3: Improve C2 Further (Weekend)
- [ ] Investigate Oct 23 C2 training approach
- [ ] Apply SAM to Challenge 2
- [ ] Target: C2 < 0.9
- [ ] Combine with best C1

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical: Don't Lose C2 Model
```bash
# Multiple backups
cp weights/challenge2/weights_challenge_2.pt weights/BACKUP_C2_1.00867.pt
cp weights/challenge2/weights_challenge_2.pt ~/BACKUP_C2_1.00867.pt
git add weights/challenge2/weights_challenge_2.pt
git commit -m "Backup C2 model - Submit 87 score 1.00867"
```

### Verification Before Submission
```bash
# Always test before submitting
python submission.py  # Should load both models successfully
python test_submission_verbose.py  # Verify predictions work
```

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate (Next Submission)
- C1: 0.8-1.0 (from SAM training)
- C2: ~1.00867 (keep current)
- **Overall: 0.9-1.0** (major improvement from 1.322!)

### Weekend (After C2 SAM Training)
- C1: 0.8-0.9 (optimized)
- C2: 0.8-0.9 (SAM applied)
- **Overall: 0.8-0.9** (top tier!)

### Goal
- Both challenges < 0.9
- Overall < 0.9
- Top 100 on leaderboard

## Key Takeaways

1. ‚úÖ **We have a winning C2 model** (1.00867 - 30.9% improvement)
2. ‚úÖ **It's already in submission.py** (weights_challenge_2.pt)
3. ‚úÖ **Don't change it** until we have something better
4. üîÑ **Focus on C1 now** (SAM training ongoing)
5. üéØ **Hybrid approach** will get us overall < 1.0

---

**Status:** Investigation complete  
**Action:** Preserve C2 model, focus on C1 training  
**Next:** Create backups, wait for C1 training  
**Timeline:** Hybrid submission tonight/tomorrow  

**Created:** October 24, 2025 17:20 UTC
