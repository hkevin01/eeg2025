# Session Memory - Oct 18, 2025

## Critical Achievement
✅ FIXED SYSTEM CRASHES - Training now safe, no more freezing!

## Problem → Solution
**Was:** 40GB RAM needed, only 31GB available → CRASH  
**Now:** HDF5 memory-mapping → 2-4GB RAM → SAFE ✓

## Files to Remember
- `scripts/preprocessing/cache_challenge1_windows_safe.py` (preprocessing)
- `train_safe_tmux.sh` (training launcher)
- `README_SESSION_OCT18.md` (start here next time)

## Status
⏳ Preprocessing running (PID: 33903)  
🚀 Ready to train after it completes  
📊 Goal: 1.23 → 0.9 NRMSE

## Competition
- Challenge 1: 7% behind
- Challenge 2: **47% behind** ← FOCUS HERE!
- Overall: 25% to improve

## Next Session
1. Verify preprocessing done
2. Run: `./train_safe_tmux.sh`
3. Monitor: No crashes!
