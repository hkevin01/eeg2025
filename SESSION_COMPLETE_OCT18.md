- Current phase (data loading/training)
- Recent epochs if training started
- Best validation score so far

### Watch Live Progress
```bash
# Challenge 1 training log (detailed)
tail -f logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_20251018_154211.log

# See just epoch info
tail -f logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_20251018_154211.log | grep -E "Epoch|NRMSE"
```

### Comprehensive Monitoring
```bash
./monitor_training.sh
```

**Shows:**
- Both Challenge 1 and Challenge 2 progress
- Running processes
- Model weights
- Recent epoch details
- Live tail commands

### Check Epoch Progress
```bash
# Count epochs completed
grep "Epoch" logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_*.log | wc -l

# Show last 5 epochs
grep -E "(Epoch|Train NRMSE|Val NRMSE)" logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_*.log | tail -15

# Best validation score
grep "Best Val NRMSE" logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_*.log | tail -1
```

### Auto-Refresh Monitoring

## üéì Technical Details

### What Changed in Code

**File: scripts/training/challenge1/train_challenge1_multi_release.py**

**Line 186:** Stimulus alignment fix
```python
# Before:
ANCHOR = "contrast_trial_start"  # Trial start (WRONG for RT)

# After:
ANCHOR = "stimulus_anchor"  # Stimulus onset (CORRECT for RT)
```

**Line 217:** Metadata descriptor
```python
# Before:
desc="contrast_trial_start"

# After:
desc="stimulus_anchor"  # Match window anchor
```

**Lines 323-359:** Enhanced model with parameterized dropout
```python
class CompactCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dropout_p=0.5):  # NEW: configurable dropout
        # 5 dropout layers with rates 0.3-0.5
        nn.Dropout(dropout_p * 0.6),  # 30%
        nn.Dropout(dropout_p * 0.8),  # 40%
        nn.Dropout(dropout_p),        # 50%
        nn.Dropout(dropout_p),        # 50%
        nn.Dropout(dropout_p * 0.8),  # 40%
```

**Lines 382-405:** L1 regularization
```python
def train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, epochs=50,
                l1_lambda=1e-5, l2_lambda=1e-4):  # NEW parameters
    
    # L2 via weight_decay
    optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3, 
                           weight_decay=l2_lambda)
    
    # L1 penalty computation
    l1_penalty = 0.0
    for param in model.parameters():
        l1_penalty += torch.sum(torch.abs(param))
    
    # Total loss = MSE + L1 (L2 via optimizer)
    loss = mse_loss + l1_lambda * l1_penalty
```

**Line 470:** More training data
```python
# Before:
releases=['R1', 'R2']  # 479 subjects

# After:
releases=['R1', 'R2', 'R3', 'R4']  # 719 subjects (+33%)
```

**Line 478:** Better validation split
```python
# Before:
releases=['R3']

# After:
releases=['R5']  # Better train/val separation
```

### Why Each Change Matters

1. **Stimulus Alignment (15-25% gain)**
   - Response time = time from stimulus to response
   - Windows MUST start at stimulus, not trial start
   - Pre-stimulus activity is noise for RT prediction
   - This is the single biggest fix

2. **More Data (10-15% gain)**
   - Deep learning improves with more data
   - 33% more subjects = better generalization
   - R5 validation is cleaner (no overlap with training)

3. **Elastic Net (5-10% gain)**
   - L1: Zeros out unimportant features (129 EEG channels)
   - L2: Prevents any single weight from dominating
   - Dropout: Prevents co-adaptation of features
   - Combined: Train NRMSE ‚âà Val NRMSE (good generalization)

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

When training completes (~21:30), we need to verify:

### Performance Targets
- ‚úÖ Challenge 1 NRMSE < 0.80 (20% improvement from 1.00)
- ‚úÖ Challenge 2 NRMSE < 1.35 (8% improvement from 1.46)
- ‚úÖ Combined NRMSE < 1.10 (11% improvement from 1.23)
- ‚úÖ Train/Val gap < 0.10 (good generalization, no overfitting)

### Model Quality
- ‚úÖ Model weights saved successfully
- ‚úÖ Training curves smooth (no divergence)
- ‚úÖ Validation NRMSE decreasing over epochs
- ‚úÖ No NaN/Inf values in loss

### Comparison to Baseline
- ‚úÖ Challenge 1: >15% improvement minimum
- ‚úÖ Challenge 2: >8% improvement minimum
- ‚úÖ Combined: >10% improvement minimum

---

## üìã Next Steps (After Training Completes)

### 1. Review Results (~21:30)
```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025

# Check completion
./check_training_simple.sh

# Extract final scores
grep "Best Val NRMSE" logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_*.log
grep "Best Val NRMSE" logs/training_comparison/challenge2_improved_*.log
```

### 2. Compare to Baseline
Calculate improvement percentages:
```python
# Challenge 1
baseline_c1 = 1.00
new_c1 = <score from log>
improvement_c1 = (baseline_c1 - new_c1) / baseline_c1 * 100

# Challenge 2
baseline_c2 = 1.46
new_c2 = <score from log>
improvement_c2 = (baseline_c2 - new_c2) / baseline_c2 * 100

# Combined
baseline_combined = 1.23
new_combined = (new_c1 + new_c2) / 2
improvement_combined = (baseline_combined - new_combined) / baseline_combined * 100
```

### 3. Check for Overfitting
```bash
# Show last 10 epochs
grep -E "(Epoch|Train NRMSE|Val NRMSE)" logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_*.log | tail -30
```

**Good signs:**
- Train NRMSE ‚âà Val NRMSE (difference < 0.05)
- Both decreasing over time
- No sudden jumps or divergence

**Bad signs (overfitting):**
- Train NRMSE << Val NRMSE (gap > 0.15)
- Train keeps decreasing but Val increases
- Need to increase regularization

### 4. If Results are Good (>15% improvement)

**Create Submission:**
```bash
python submission.py
```

**Check submission file:**
```bash
ls -lh submission_*.csv
head -20 submission_*.csv
```

**Upload to competition platform**
- Follow competition submission instructions
- Note your expected scores in submission comment
- Track leaderboard position

### 5. If Results Need Tuning

**If Overfitting (Train << Val):**
```python
# Increase regularization
model = CompactCNN(dropout_p=0.6)  # Was 0.5
train_model(..., l1_lambda=5e-5, l2_lambda=5e-4)  # Was 1e-5, 1e-4
```

**If Underfitting (Both scores high):**
```python
# Decrease regularization
model = CompactCNN(dropout_p=0.4)  # Was 0.5
train_model(..., l1_lambda=1e-6, l2_lambda=1e-5)  # Was 1e-5, 1e-4
```

**If Challenge 1 still not good enough:**
- See `TRAINING_IMPROVEMENTS_TODO.md`
- Next best improvements:
  1. Attention mechanisms (15-20% gain)
  2. Multi-scale temporal (10-15% gain)
  3. Channel attention (5-10% gain)

### 6. Document Results

Create a results summary:
```bash
cat > RESULTS_$(date +%Y%m%d).md << EOF
# Training Results - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## Scores
- Challenge 1: X.XX NRMSE (baseline: 1.00, improvement: XX%)
- Challenge 2: X.XX NRMSE (baseline: 1.46, improvement: XX%)
- Combined: X.XX NRMSE (baseline: 1.23, improvement: XX%)

## Improvements Applied
1. Stimulus-aligned windows
2. R4 training data (+33%)
3. L1+L2+Dropout regularization

## Observations
- Train/Val gap: X.XX (overfitting status)
- Training stability: good/bad
- Next improvements to try: ...
