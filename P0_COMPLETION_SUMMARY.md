### Task 4: Inference Speed Benchmark ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Deliverables**:
- ✅ `test_inference_speed_simple.py` - Standalone benchmark
- ✅ Benchmark runs and measures latency
- ⚠️ Current model: ~95ms (needs optimization)

**Benchmark Results**:
```
⏱️  Results:
   Average: 94.92 ms ⚠️
   P95: 110.94 ms
   P99: 126.04 ms
   Model: 5,027,841 parameters (19.18 MB)
```

**Action Required**:
- Model optimization needed to meet <50ms requirement
- Consider: quantization, pruning, TensorRT, smaller model
- This is expected - optimization is a post-P0 task

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Mitigations

### Issue 1: Model Latency (95ms > 50ms target)
**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: Production deployment requirement  
**Mitigation**:
- This is expected at baseline
- Multiple optimization paths available:
  - Model quantization (INT8 can give 2-4x speedup)
  - Pruning (remove 30-50% of weights)
  - Distillation (train smaller student model)
  - TensorRT optimization (GPU)
  - Reduce model size (fewer layers/dims)

### Issue 2: Limited Data (2 subjects)
**Severity**: Low  
**Impact**: Can't train yet, but foundation validated  
**Mitigation**:
- Download more subjects (simple AWS S3 command)
- Scripts are working and tested
- Can download 50+ subjects in ~1-2 hours

### Issue 3: Import Dependencies in Full Model
**Severity**: Low  
**Impact**: Complex model has many dependencies  
**Mitigation**:
- Simplified benchmark model works
- Full model testing can wait until training phase
- Dependencies can be resolved when needed
