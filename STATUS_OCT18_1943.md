## ‚úÖ Preprocessing COMPLETE!

**HDF5 files created successfully:**
```
challenge1_R1_windows.h5  660MB
challenge1_R2_windows.h5  681MB  
challenge1_R3_windows.h5  853MB
challenge1_R4_windows.h5  1.5GB
Total: ~3.7GB
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue Identified

The training script launched in tmux is the OLD version that:
- Loads data directly from EEGChallengeDataset
- Doesn't use the cached HDF5 files
- Will still consume 40GB+ RAM ‚Üí WILL CRASH!

## üîß Solution Needed

Create HDF5-based training script that:
1. Loads from cached HDF5 files
2. Uses memory-mapped access
3. Stays within 2-4GB RAM

## üìã Next Steps

1. Stop current tmux training (it will crash)
2. Create train_challenge1_hdf5.py
3. Update train_safe_tmux.sh to use new script
4. Relaunch training with HDF5 data
