# Task-Specific Advanced Methods - Documentation Update

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Documentation Updated

---

## üìù What Was Added

Added comprehensive documentation of **task-specific advanced methods** for future exploration across 5 cognitive tasks from the HBN dataset.

### Files Updated

1. **README.md** - New section "Task-Specific Advanced Methods (Planned)"
2. **docs/methods/METHOD_DESCRIPTION.md** - Detailed technical specifications

---

## üß† Task-Specific Methods Overview

### 1. Resting State (RS)
**Methods:** Spectral + Connectivity Analysis

**Components:**
- Power spectral density (PSD) features
- Functional connectivity matrices (coherence, PLV)
- Graph neural networks for brain topology
- Multivariate autoregressive models

**Rationale:** Resting state shows rich oscillatory dynamics and network organization that frequency-domain features capture better than raw temporal data.

---

### 2. Surround Suppression (SuS)
**Methods:** Convolutional Layers + Attention Mechanisms

**Components:**
- Spatial convolutions for retinotopic mapping
- Center-surround attention mechanisms
- Multi-scale receptive fields
- Visual cortex-inspired hierarchical processing

**Rationale:** Visual suppression requires spatial context modeling similar to V1 receptive field properties.

---

### 3. Movie Watching (MW)
**Methods:** Temporal Transformers + Dynamic Connectivity

**Components:**
- Temporal transformers for long sequences
- Sliding-window dynamic connectivity
- Time-varying graph neural networks
- Attention for salient moments

**Rationale:** Movies induce complex temporal dynamics requiring long-range dependency modeling and time-varying network analysis.

---

### 4. Contrast Change Detection (CCD)
**Methods:** ERP Extraction + Motor Preparation Modeling

**Components:**
- Event-related potential (ERP) template matching
- Motor cortex feature extraction (central electrodes)
- Pre-response window analysis (-500ms to 0ms)
- Decision-related negativity features

**Rationale:** Detection tasks produce stereotyped ERPs (P300, N200) and motor preparation signals that are well-characterized.

**Status:** Currently our best task (NRMSE 0.26) - already capturing ERP features implicitly!

---

### 5. Symbol Search (SyS)
**Methods:** Spatial Attention Modeling

**Components:**
- Visual search attention maps
- Parietal cortex emphasis (P3, P4, Pz)
- Working memory load indicators
- Eye movement-related potentials

**Rationale:** Symbol search engages visual attention (parietal) and working memory (frontal-parietal) networks.

## üìä Comparison Table

| Task | Current Method | Proposed Enhancement | Expected Gain |
|------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **RS** | Sparse CNN | + Spectral/Connectivity | 10-15% |
| **SuS** | Sparse CNN | + Spatial Attention | 10-15% |
| **MW** | Sparse CNN | + Temporal Transformers | 10-15% |
| **CCD** | Sparse CNN ‚≠ê | + ERP Features | 5-10% |
| **SyS** | Sparse CNN | + Parietal Focus | 10-15% |

**Overall Projected Improvement:** 0.26 ‚Üí 0.23-0.25 NRMSE

## üîÑ Implementation Status

### Current State
‚úÖ **Baseline established:** Sparse attention CNN (NRMSE 0.26)  
‚úÖ **Documentation complete:** Methods fully specified in README + METHOD_DESCRIPTION  
‚úÖ **Architecture designs:** Pseudocode provided for all 5 tasks

### Why Not Implemented Yet

1. **Strong baseline:** Current performance is competitive (41.8% improvement over naive baseline)
2. **Computational cost:** Each task-specific model requires separate training/tuning
3. **Competition timeline:** 2 weeks remaining - prioritizing robust solution
4. **Overfitting risk:** Limited training data may not support complex task-specific architectures

### Implementation Priority

1. **High:** CCD (already best task, can optimize further)
2. **Medium:** RS (well-studied, common task)
3. **Low:** MW, SuS, SyS (more experimental, less priority)

## üí° Code Examples Provided

### Resting State Network
```python
class RestingStateNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.spectral_encoder = WaveletEncoder(bands=['delta', 'theta', 'alpha', 'beta', 'gamma'])
        self.connectivity = FunctionalConnectivity(method='coherence')
        self.gnn = GraphConvNet(num_nodes=129)
```

### Movie Watching Network
```python
class MovieWatchingNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.temporal_transformer = TemporalTransformer(max_len=10000)
        self.dynamic_conn = SlidingWindowConnectivity(window_size=200)
```

---

## üìà Expected Impact

### If Fully Implemented

**Performance:**
- Current: 0.26 NRMSE (Challenge 1)
- Projected: 0.23-0.25 NRMSE
- Improvement: 8-12% additional gain

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚öñÔ∏è Increased model complexity
- ‚öñÔ∏è Longer training time (5x models vs 1)
- ‚öñÔ∏è Higher hyperparameter tuning cost
- ‚öñÔ∏è Risk of task-specific overfitting

**Competition Impact:**
- Could secure top 3 position
- Would differentiate from general-purpose approaches
- Demonstrates neuroscience domain knowledge
