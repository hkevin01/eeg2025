# Critical Bug Fixes - October 18, 2025

## Overview

Three critical bugs were identified and fixed in the submission.py file that were causing repeated submission failures on Codabench.

---

## Bug #1: Broken Fallback Weight Loading

### Problem
The Challenge 2 fallback code found the weights file but **never actually loaded it**:

```python
# BROKEN CODE (lines 268-276)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning loading Challenge 2 model: {e}")
    print(f"   Trying fallback: weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt")
    try:
        fallback_path = resolve_path("weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt")
        # Note: This won't work with TCN architecture, just for compatibility
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Fallback model architecture mismatch - using untrained TCN")
    except Exception:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  No weights found, using untrained model")
```

**Issues:**
1. Found the fallback file but never called `torch.load()`
2. Never called `load_state_dict()` to load weights into model
3. Just printed warning and continued with untrained model
4. Result: Random weights ‚Üí garbage predictions ‚Üí execution failure

### Solution

```python
# FIXED CODE
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning loading Challenge 2 TCN model: {e}")
    print("   Trying fallback: weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt")
    try:
        fallback_path = resolve_path("weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt")
        checkpoint = torch.load(fallback_path, map_location=self.device, weights_only=False)
        
        if 'model_state_dict' in checkpoint:
            self.model_externalizing.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
            print("‚úÖ Loaded Challenge 2 CompactCNN from fallback")
            print(f"   Val Loss: {checkpoint.get('val_loss', 'N/A')}")
        else:
            self.model_externalizing.load_state_dict(checkpoint)
            print("‚úÖ Loaded Challenge 2 CompactCNN from fallback")
    except Exception as fallback_error:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Fallback also failed: {fallback_error}")
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è  Using untrained model")
```

**Changes:**
- Added `torch.load()` to actually load the checkpoint
- Added `load_state_dict()` to load weights into model
- Handle both checkpoint formats (with/without `model_state_dict` key)
- Report validation loss on success
- Only use untrained model if both primary and fallback fail

---

## Bug #2: Missing NumPy Import

### Problem
The predict methods used `.numpy()` to convert torch tensors to numpy arrays, but **numpy was never imported**:

```python
# BROKEN CODE
def predict_response_time(self, eeg_data):
    with torch.no_grad():
        eeg_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(eeg_data).to(self.device)
        predictions = self.model_response_time(eeg_tensor)
        return predictions.cpu().numpy().flatten()  # ‚Üê .numpy() requires import!
```

**Issues:**
1. `.numpy()` is a torch.Tensor method that requires numpy to be imported
2. Without import, causes: `AttributeError: 'Tensor' object has no attribute 'numpy'`
3. Code worked locally if numpy was in global scope, but failed in isolated Codabench environment

### Solution

```python
# FIXED CODE - Added at top of file
import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from pathlib import Path
```

**Changes:**
- Added `import numpy as np` at line 11
- Now `.numpy()` works correctly in both predict methods
- Returns proper numpy arrays instead of failing

---

## Bug #3: Wrong API Format

### Problem
The submission.py didn't match the **competition starter kit API format**:

**Wrong __init__ signature:**
```python
# BROKEN CODE
def __init__(self):
    self.device = torch.device("cpu")
    # ...
```

**Wrong method names:**
```python
# BROKEN CODE
def predict_response_time(self, eeg_data):
    # ...

def predict_externalizing(self, eeg_data):
    # ...
```

**Issues:**
1. Competition expects `__init__(self, SFREQ, DEVICE)` not `__init__(self)`
2. Competition expects `get_model_challenge_1()` and `get_model_challenge_2()` methods
3. Wrong method signatures won't work with competition evaluation system

### Solution

**Correct __init__ signature:**
```python
# FIXED CODE
def __init__(self, SFREQ, DEVICE):
    self.sfreq = SFREQ
    self.device = DEVICE
    # ...
```

**Correct method names and signatures:**
```python
# FIXED CODE
def get_model_challenge_1(self):
    """Returns the model for Challenge 1"""
    return self.model_response_time

def get_model_challenge_2(self):
    """Returns the model for Challenge 2"""
    return self.model_externalizing
```

**Changes:**
- Rewrote `__init__` to accept `SFREQ` and `DEVICE` parameters
- Changed method names from `predict_*()` to `get_model_*()`
- Methods now return model objects instead of making predictions
- Matches exact competition starter kit API format

## Architecture Fix: CompactExternalizingCNN

### Problem
The CompactExternalizingCNN architecture definition didn't match the saved weights structure:

**Wrong architecture:**
```python
# Features expected: features.0.weight, features.1.weight, etc.
# Weights had: network.0.conv1.weight, network.0.bn1.weight, etc.
```

### Solution
Updated CompactExternalizingCNN to match the exact architecture from saved weights:

```python
class CompactExternalizingCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Residual blocks (matching saved weights structure)
        self.network = nn.ModuleList([
            # Block 0: 129 ‚Üí 64
            nn.ModuleDict({
                'conv1': nn.Conv1d(129, 64, 7, padding=3),
                'bn1': nn.BatchNorm1d(64),
                'conv2': nn.Conv1d(64, 64, 7, padding=3),
                'bn2': nn.BatchNorm1d(64),
                'downsample': nn.Conv1d(129, 64, 1)
            }),
            # ... (4 more blocks)
        ])
        
        self.fc = nn.Linear(64, 1)
```

**Changes:**
- Used ModuleList and ModuleDict to match saved weight structure
- Added proper residual connections with downsample layers
- Now weights load correctly without state dict mismatches

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Test Fallback Paths
- Don't assume fallback code works without explicit testing
- Test with the exact files that will be in the package
- Verify weights actually load, not just that file is found

### 2. Check All Imports
- Missing imports can fail in isolated environments
- Even if code works locally, may fail in competition environment
- Use linters to catch missing imports early

### 3. Match Competition API Exactly
- Read starter kit documentation carefully
- Match method signatures exactly
- Test with competition's expected inputs/outputs
- Don't assume your API will work if it's different

### 4. Test in Clean Environment
- Local testing should match competition environment as closely as possible
- Test with exact package contents
- Use isolated Python environment

### 5. Verify Package Structure
- Competition may require specific zip structure (no folders, single level)
- Extract and verify what's actually in the package
- Test the extracted files, not just the source files
