# Architecture Decision: Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)

## Decision Date
October 16, 2025

## Status
‚úÖ **ACCEPTED** - Validated by Challenge 1 results (65% improvement)

## Context

We needed to choose a neural network architecture for EEG time series prediction in the EEG 2025 Challenge. The input is 129-channel EEG data with 200 time points (2 seconds at 100Hz).

### Requirements
1. Handle long-range temporal dependencies in EEG
2. Capture multi-channel spatial patterns
3. Efficient (limited parameters for submission < 50 MB)
4. Fast inference for competition evaluation
5. Good generalization (avoid overfitting with limited data)

### Constraints
- Input shape: (batch, 129 channels, 200 time points)
- Output: Single regression value
- Competition metric: NRMSE (lower is better)
- Baseline Challenge 1: 0.2832 NRMSE
- Baseline Challenge 2: 0.2917 NRMSE

## Decision

**Chosen Architecture:** Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with dilated causal convolutions

### Architecture Specifications

```python
TCN_EEG(
    num_channels=129,        # EEG input channels
    num_outputs=1,           # Single regression output
    num_filters=48,          # Convolutional filters per block
    kernel_size=7,           # Temporal kernel size
    dropout=0.3,             # Regularization
    num_levels=5             # Number of temporal blocks
)
```

**Key Components:**

1. **Temporal Blocks (5 levels):**
   - Dilated causal Conv1d (dilation: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
   - Batch Normalization
   - ReLU activation
   - Dropout (0.3)
   - Residual connections

2. **Progressive Dilation:**
   - Level 0: Dilation 1 (receptive field: 7)
   - Level 1: Dilation 2 (receptive field: 15)
   - Level 2: Dilation 4 (receptive field: 31)
   - Level 3: Dilation 8 (receptive field: 63)
   - Level 4: Dilation 16 (receptive field: 127)

3. **Final Layer:**
   - Global average pooling over time
   - Linear layer: 48 ‚Üí 1

**Total Parameters:** 196,225

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. LSTM/GRU Recurrent Networks
**Pros:**
- Natural for sequential data
- Captures temporal dependencies
- Well-established for EEG

**Cons:**
- Sequential processing (slow)
- Vanishing/exploding gradients with long sequences
- Harder to parallelize
- Typically needs more parameters for comparable performance

**Verdict:** ‚ùå Rejected - Too slow, harder to train

### 2. Transformer with Self-Attention
**Pros:**
- State-of-the-art for sequences
- Parallel processing
- Flexible attention patterns

**Cons:**
- Memory intensive (O(n¬≤) attention)
- Many parameters (>500K for comparable receptive field)
- Requires more data to train effectively
- Our previous attempt: 846K parameters, worse performance

**Verdict:** ‚ùå Rejected - Too large, not enough data

### 3. Sparse Attention Models
**Pros:**
- Reduced memory compared to full attention
- Targeted attention patterns
- We had a working implementation

**Cons:**
- Still relatively large (846K parameters)
- Complex architecture
- Baseline performance only (~0.28 NRMSE)

**Verdict:** ‚ùå Rejected - Didn't provide expected benefit

### 4. WaveNet-style Architecture
**Pros:**
- Similar to TCN
- Proven for audio (similar to EEG)
- Dilated convolutions

**Cons:**
- Originally designed for generation, not regression
- More complex gating mechanisms
- TCN is simpler and equally effective

**Verdict:** ‚ùå Rejected - TCN is simpler, equally good

### 5. Simple 1D CNN
**Pros:**
- Very simple
- Fast
- Few parameters

**Cons:**
- Limited receptive field
- Can't capture long-range dependencies
- Poor for EEG with complex temporal patterns

**Verdict:** ‚ùå Rejected - Insufficient capacity

## Rationale

### Why TCN Won

1. **Efficiency:**
   - 196K parameters (vs 846K attention model)
   - 77% parameter reduction
   - Fits easily in 50 MB submission limit

2. **Receptive Field:**
   - Effective receptive field: 127 time points
   - Covers 63% of input (127/200)
   - Captures long-range EEG dynamics

3. **Causality:**
   - Causal convolutions respect time order
   - Appropriate for EEG prediction tasks
   - Prevents information leakage from future

4. **Proven Results:**
   - Challenge 1: Val loss 0.010170 (NRMSE ~0.10)
   - 65% improvement over baseline (0.2832 ‚Üí 0.10)
   - Better than all previous architectures we tried

5. **Training Stability:**
   - Batch normalization in each block
   - Residual connections prevent degradation
   - Dropout prevents overfitting
   - Converged in 2 epochs (Challenge 1)

6. **Computational Efficiency:**
   - Parallel processing across time steps
   - Fast inference (< 1ms per sample)
   - Suitable for competition evaluation

## Implementation Details

### Temporal Block Structure

```python
class TemporalBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, n_inputs, n_outputs, kernel_size, dilation, dropout=0.2):
        super().__init__()
        padding = (kernel_size - 1) * dilation
        
        # First conv path
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv1d(n_inputs, n_outputs, kernel_size,
                               padding=padding, dilation=dilation)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(n_outputs)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.dropout1 = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        
        # Second conv path
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv1d(n_outputs, n_outputs, kernel_size,
                               padding=padding, dilation=dilation)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm1d(n_outputs)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
        self.dropout2 = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        
        # Residual connection
        self.downsample = nn.Conv1d(n_inputs, n_outputs, 1) if n_inputs != n_outputs else None
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Main path
        out = self.conv1(x)
        out = self.bn1(out)
        out = self.relu1(out)
        out = self.dropout1(out)
        
        out = self.conv2(out)
        out = self.bn2(out)
        out = self.relu2(out)
        out = self.dropout2(out)
        
        # Remove extra padding (causal)
        out = out[:, :, :x.size(2)]
        
        # Residual
        res = x if self.downsample is None else self.downsample(x)
        return self.relu(out + res)
```

   - Could be addressed with more levels

2. **Channel Independence:**
   - Each temporal block operates on all channels
   - Doesn't explicitly model spatial relationships

   - **Mitigation:** Using same architecture, monitoring closely

2. **Overfitting:**
   - Relatively large model for dataset size
   - Dropout helps but may not be sufficient
   - **Mitigation:** Early stopping, validation monitoring

3. **Competition-Specific:**
   - Optimized for this specific EEG format
   - May not generalize to other EEG tasks
   - **Mitigation:** Document assumptions clearly
