# After:
i_trial = window_ind[0] if isinstance(window_ind, (list, np.ndarray)) else window_ind
rt = metadata.iloc[i_trial]['rt_from_stimulus']
```

## October 18, 2025 - Critical Bug Fixes & Workspace Organization

### 🐛 Three Critical Bugs Fixed

#### Bug #1: Broken Fallback Weight Loading
- **Issue:** Challenge 2 fallback code found weights file but never loaded it
- **Impact:** Model ran with untrained weights → garbage predictions → submission failure
- **Location:** submission.py lines 268-276
- **Fix:** Added `torch.load()` and `load_state_dict()` calls to actually load the weights
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED

#### Bug #2: Missing NumPy Import
- **Issue:** predict methods used `.numpy()` but numpy wasn't imported
- **Impact:** AttributeError when converting torch tensors to numpy arrays
- **Location:** submission.py line 11 (missing import)
- **Fix:** Added `import numpy as np` at top of file
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED

#### Bug #3: Wrong API Format
- **Issue:** submission.py didn't match competition starter kit API
  - Used `__init__(self)` instead of `__init__(self, SFREQ, DEVICE)`
  - Used `predict_*()` methods instead of `get_model_*()`
  - Wrong method signatures
