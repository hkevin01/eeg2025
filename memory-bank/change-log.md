        # ... rest of block
```

### 18:30 - Fixed Window Indexing Bug
**Component:** `scripts/train_tcn_competition_data.py`  
**Changes:**
- Fixed window_ind indexing in dataset creation
- Changed from treating window_ind as scalar to accessing array element [0]
- Properly extracts trial index from [i_trial, i_start, i_stop] array

**Code Fix:**
```python
# Before: rt = metadata.iloc[window_ind]['rt_from_stimulus']  # WRONG
# After:
i_trial = window_ind[0] if isinstance(window_ind, (list, np.ndarray)) else window_ind
rt = metadata.iloc[i_trial]['rt_from_stimulus']
```

**Testing:**
- Extracted 14,691 samples successfully (was 0 before)
- R1: 2,880 samples
- R2: 3,570 samples
- R3: 5,052 samples
- R4: 3,189 samples

**Impact:**
- Enabled successful Challenge 1 training
- Fixed critical data loading bug
- All releases now contributing samples

### 18:00 - Fixed Monitor Script Log Detection
**Component:** `scripts/monitoring/monitor_training_enhanced.sh`  
**Changes:**
- Updated log file detection pattern on line 17
- Added `train_fixed*.log` and `train_independent*.log` to search
- Now finds correct training log files

**Code:**
```bash
# Before: COMP_LOG=$(ls -t logs/train_real*.log logs/train_tcn*.log 2>/dev/null | head -1)
# After:
COMP_LOG=$(ls -t logs/train_real*.log logs/train_fixed*.log logs/train_independent*.log logs/train_tcn*.log 2>/dev/null | head -1)
```

**Testing:**
- Monitor correctly shows training status
- Displays "0 samples" resolved (was looking at wrong log)
- Now tracks actual training progress

**Impact:**
- Accurate training monitoring
- Eliminated user confusion about sample counts
- Better visibility into training progress
