# Session Summary - Part 2: The Solution

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED & TESTED

## HDF5 Memory-Mapped Solution

**Key Innovation:**
- Preprocess once → Save to disk (HDF5 compressed)
- Training loads batches on-demand (memory-mapped)
- **RAM reduction: 40GB+ → 2-4GB** (10x improvement!)

## Safety Infrastructure

**Memory Monitoring:**
```python
MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = 85%
- Check before each operation
- Auto-stop if exceeded
- Log all checks
```

**Error Handling:**
- Try-except on all operations
- Resume capability (skip completed)
- Graceful degradation
- Detailed logging with timestamps

**Crash Prevention:**
- psutil real-time monitoring
- Checkpoint after each release
- Exit codes for automation
- Emergency recovery procedures
