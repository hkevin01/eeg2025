# GPU Training Progress Summary - October 22, 2025

## What We Accomplished Today

### üîç **Problem Diagnosis**
- Identified that AMD RX 5600 XT (gfx1010) experiences `HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_APERTURE_VIOLATION`
- Root cause: Standard PyTorch ROCm binaries only support server GPUs, not consumer gfx1010
- User provided research showing ROCm SDK Builder as the solution for unsupported consumer GPUs

### üõ†Ô∏è **Solution Implementation**
- Downloaded and configured ROCm SDK Builder 6.1.2 for custom PyTorch compilation
- Successfully configured build environment with `GPU_BUILD_AMD_NAVI10_GFX1010=1`
- Downloaded 83 ROCm repositories totaling ~137 components to build
- Applied consumer GPU patches specifically for gfx1010 architecture support

### üîÑ **Current Build Status (5/137 components completed)**
- ‚úÖ **rocm-core** - ROCm infrastructure foundation
- ‚úÖ **cmake, zstd, python, ffmpeg7** - Essential build dependencies  
- üîÑ **llvm-project** - Currently building critical LLVM/Clang toolchain (36% complete)
- ‚è≥ **Upcoming**: HIP runtime, rocBLAS, rocFFT, and **PyTorch 2.4.1** with gfx1010 support

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Timeline & Resources**
- **Build Started**: 13:44 (16 minutes elapsed)
- **Current Load**: 12.25 (all CPU cores actively compiling)
- **Estimated Completion**: 3-4 hours remaining
- **Target**: Custom PyTorch installation at `/opt/rocm_sdk_612`

### üéØ **Expected Outcome**
- Complete ROCm SDK 6.1.2 with PyTorch that includes gfx1010 kernels
- Resolution of `HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_APERTURE_VIOLATION` error
- Full GPU acceleration for EEG training on AMD RX 5600 XT
- Significant performance improvement over CPU-only training

### üìã **Next Session Tasks**
1. Monitor build completion (~3-4 hours)
2. Install custom PyTorch with gfx1010 support
3. Test GPU detection and basic operations
4. Resume EEG training with GPU acceleration
5. Benchmark performance vs CPU training
