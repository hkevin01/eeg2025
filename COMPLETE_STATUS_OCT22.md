## üéØ Bottom Line

**You have 3 options right now:**

1. **Upload submission NOW** - You already have excellent weights (val_loss=0.000084)
2. **Try ROCm 5.7 GPU** - 30 min test, could save 11 hours if it works
3. **Wait for CPU** - 8 hours remaining for fast training to finish

All three are valid! üéâ

## üîÑ Training Status

### Fast CPU Training (In Progress)
```
Started:  Oct 21, 23:30
Progress: Epoch 1, batch 350/811 (43%)
Speed:    ~5 sec/batch
ETA:      ~8 hours total (5 hours remaining)
PID:      1548474, 1548564
Log:      logs/training_c2_fast_20251021_233017.log
Settings: batch_size=128, max_epochs=3
Loss:     0.956 ‚Üí 0.105 (improving nicely)
```

### GPU Training (Failed - ROCm 6.2)
```
Status:   ‚ùå Failed
Issue:    HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_APERTURE_VIOLATION
Cause:    ROCm 6.2 + gfx1030 + EEGNeX incompatibility
Fix:      Community suggests ROCm 5.x works better
Docs:     See ROCM_5X_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md
```

## üöÄ GPU Acceleration Option

### Community Insight (Thank you!)
> "I think you need to be on ROCm 5.x but if you get ollama working 
> under this situation, you've got a fantastic jumping off point for 
> your pytorch buildout."

### Why ROCm 5.x?
- Better gfx1030 (RX 5600 XT) compatibility
- ROCm 6.x has known regressions for RDNA1/2 GPUs
- Ollama may already be using it successfully

### Quick Test (30 minutes)
```bash
# Install PyTorch with ROCm 5.7 in new environment
conda create -n eeg_rocm5 python=3.11 -y
conda activate eeg_rocm5
pip3 install torch==2.2.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.7
pip3 install braindecode mne scikit-learn h5py numpy pandas

# Test EEGNeX
python3 -c "
import torch
from braindecode.models import EEGNeX
model = EEGNeX(n_outputs=1, n_chans=129, n_times=200, sfreq=100).cuda()
x = torch.randn(16, 129, 200).cuda()
print(f'‚úÖ Works! {model(x).shape}')
"
```

### If Successful
- **GPU training**: 2 hours for 3 epochs
- **CPU training**: 8 hours for 3 epochs
- **Savings**: 6 hours ‚ö°

## üìä Performance Comparison

| Method | Time/Epoch | Total (3 epochs) | Speed vs CPU |
|--------|------------|------------------|--------------|
| Original CPU (batch=16) | 30 hours | 90 hours | 1x |
| Fast CPU (batch=128) | 7 hours | 21 hours | 4.3x |
| GPU with ROCm 5.7 (est) | 40 min | 2 hours | 45x |

## üéì Key Learnings

1. **Batch size matters**: 16‚Üí128 = 8x faster training
2. **Hardware compatibility**: ROCm 6.x has regressions for older GPUs
3. **Community knowledge**: ROCm 5.x recommended for gfx1030
4. **Have backups**: CPU training works while debugging GPU
5. **Submit early**: You already have excellent weights!

## ‚úÖ Recommended Actions (Pick One)

### Action A: Upload Now (0 minutes)
```bash
# You're ready to compete!
firefox https://www.codabench.org/competitions/4287/

```

### Action B: Try ROCm 5.7 (30 min + 2 hrs)
```bash
# Quick GPU test
conda create -n eeg_rocm5 python=3.11 -y
conda activate eeg_rocm5
pip3 install torch==2.2.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.7
pip3 install braindecode mne scikit-learn h5py numpy pandas
# If test passes ‚Üí start GPU training
```

### Action C: Wait for CPU (8 hours)
```bash
# Monitor progress
tail -f logs/training_c2_fast_20251021_233017.log
# Update submission when done
```
