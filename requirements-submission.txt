# Minimal Requirements for Competition Submission
# These are the ONLY dependencies used in submission.py
# Last verified: November 1, 2025

# Core Dependencies (submission runtime)
torch>=1.13.0,<3.0.0     # Neural network framework (weights_only param requires 1.13+)
numpy>=1.20.0,<2.0.0     # Array operations (avoid NumPy 2.0 breaking changes)

# EEG-Specific (Challenge 2 only)
braindecode>=0.8.0,<2.0.0  # EEGNeX model for Challenge 2
                            # WARNING: Availability on competition platform NOT VERIFIED
                            # V10 success suggests it IS available

# Optional (if needed by platform)
scikit-learn>=1.0.0      # Ridge regression for calibration (V13 only)

# Notes:
# - Python 3.8+ required (competition likely uses 3.8-3.11)
# - pathlib, json are standard library (no install needed)
# - V10 submission works, suggesting these are available on platform
# - braindecode is CRITICAL - if unavailable, need fallback version
