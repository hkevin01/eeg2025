## ⚡ TRAINING IN PROGRESS

**Tmux Session**: `eeg_training` ✅ RUNNING  
**Check Status**: `tmux attach -t eeg_training` (Ctrl+B then D to detach)

---

## 📋 Quick Todo

```markdown
### Phase 1: Subject-Aware Validation Testing

**Completed** ✅
- [x] Add subject IDs to all cached data
- [x] Create subject-aware training script
- [x] Start training in tmux
- [x] Model 1 (R1-R3): Val NRMSE 0.1769 ✅

**In Progress** 🔄
- [ ] Model 1 retraining (currently running)
- [ ] Model 2 (R1-R2-R4): ~4 min ⏳
- [ ] Model 3 (ALL R-sets): ~5 min ⏳

**Next Steps** ⏳ (~3:30 PM)
- [ ] Create submission packages
- [ ] Upload to Codabench
- [ ] Wait for test results

**Tomorrow** ⏳
- [ ] Correlation analysis (Val vs Test)
- [ ] DECISION: Proceed to Phase 2 or accept position?
```

---

## 🎯 Goal

Test if subject-aware validation correlates with test scores (>0.7 correlation).

**If YES**: Can optimize with confidence → Phase 2  
**If NO**: Validation still unreliable → Accept top 6% position

## 📊 Expected Completion

**Training**: ~3:15 PM EST (15 minutes from now)  
**Submissions**: ~4:30 PM EST  
**Results**: Tomorrow morning
