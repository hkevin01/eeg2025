# Root Directory Organization - Complete âœ…

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** Successfully organized without disrupting running processes

## Summary

Cleaned up the root directory by moving 49 old files to organized archive structure while keeping all active processes running.

## What Was Done

### Files Moved (49 total)

**Scripts (18 files):**
- 3 monitoring scripts â†’ `archive/scripts/monitoring/`
- 10 training scripts â†’ `archive/scripts/training/`
- 5 test scripts â†’ `archive/scripts/testing/`

**Documentation (31 files):**
- 7 status reports â†’ `archive/docs/status_reports/`
- 10 session docs â†’ `archive/docs/sessions/`
- 4 overnight docs â†’ `archive/docs/overnight/`
- 1 submission doc â†’ `archive/docs/submission/`
- 9 other docs â†’ `archive/docs/`

### New Structure Created

```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ monitor_challenge2.sh
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ quick_training_status.sh
â””â”€â”€ training/              # Active training scripts
    â””â”€â”€ train_challenge2_correct.py
```

## Files Remaining in Root

**Essential (7):**
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `submission.py` - Competition submission file
- `setup.py` - Package setup
- `test_submission_verbose.py` - Submission tester
- `requirements.txt` / `requirements-dev.txt` - Dependencies
- `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration
- `Makefile` - Build commands

**Active Documentation (2):**
- `CHALLENGE2_TRAINING_STATUS.md` - Current training status
- `WATCHDOG_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Watchdog reference

**Active Scripts (5 - kept for convenience):**
- `watchdog_challenge2.sh` - Watchdog (currently running)
- `manage_watchdog.sh` - Watchdog control
- `monitor_challenge2.sh` - Training monitor
- `quick_training_status.sh` - Quick status
- `train_challenge2_correct.py` - Training script (currently running)

**Utility (1):**
- `organize_root_files.sh` - This organization script

## Verification

### Before Organization
- Root had 60+ files (.sh, .py, .md)
- Difficult to find current vs. old files
- Cluttered and hard to navigate

### After Organization
- Root has ~15 files (only essential and active)
- Clear separation: active vs. archived
- Well-documented with READMEs

### Processes Unaffected
```
âœ… Training: RUNNING (PID 548497, 27+ min runtime)
âœ… Watchdog: ACTIVE (PID 560789, monitoring)
âœ… Progress: Epoch 1/20, Batch 700/5214
âœ… All scripts: FUNCTIONAL
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Root** - Easy to find what you need
2. **Preserved History** - All old files archived with context
3. **Better Organization** - Scripts grouped by purpose
4. **Documented** - READMEs explain contents
5. **No Disruption** - All running processes continue normally

## Quick Reference

**Check training status:**
```bash
./quick_training_status.sh
```

**Monitor training:**
```bash
./monitor_challenge2.sh
```

**Control watchdog:**
```bash
./manage_watchdog.sh status
```

**Find old files:**
```bash
# See what's in archive
cat archive/README.md

# Browse archived scripts
ls -la archive/scripts/*/

# Browse archived docs
ls -la archive/docs/*/
```

## Notes

- Active scripts are in both root (convenience) and `scripts/` (organized)
- Archive preserves all historical context
- READMEs in `archive/` and `scripts/` provide detailed documentation
- Organization script can be rerun if needed
- No files were deleted - everything preserved

## Next Steps

1. Continue training (no action needed)
2. Optionally remove script copies from root to make it even cleaner
3. All future scripts should go in `scripts/monitoring/` or `scripts/training/`
4. Old documents should go in `archive/docs/`

**Organization Script:** `organize_root_files.sh`  
**Execution Time:** < 1 second  
**Files Affected:** 0 (all moved, none modified)  
**Processes Disrupted:** 0  
**Success Rate:** 100%

âœ… **Project is now beautifully organized!** ðŸŽ‰
