# ✅ TODO - Immediate Actions

## RIGHT NOW (Next 30 minutes):

```markdown
- [ ] **Step 1:** Upload v5 submission to Codabench
      File: eeg2025_submission_tta_v5.zip (9.3 MB)
      URL: https://www.codabench.org/competitions/4287/
      Expected: 0.25-0.26 NRMSE (5-10% improvement)

- [ ] **Step 2:** Start TCN training in background
      Command: cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025 && mkdir -p logs && nohup python scripts/train_challenge1_tcn.py > logs/train_tcn_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &
      Time: 4-8 hours
      Monitor: tail -f logs/train_tcn_*.log

- [ ] **Step 3:** Wait for v5 results (1-2 hours)
      Check Codabench dashboard regularly
      If good → Continue with advanced training
      If bad → Adjust TTA parameters
```

## CLARIFICATION: TTA vs Training

**You asked:** "redo the training with the TTA integrated"

**Answer:**
- ❌ TTA does NOT require retraining
- ✅ TTA is applied at TEST TIME (inference only)
- ✅ v5 already has TTA integrated with existing models
- ✅ No need to "redo training" for TTA to work

**To improve further:**
- Train NEW models (TCN, S4, Multi-task, Ensemble)
- Those new models will take 4-48 hours to train
- THEN apply TTA to those new models too

## FILES ARE CORRECT

**Submission format verified:**
```
eeg2025_submission_tta_v5.zip:
├── submission.py                        ✅ Required
├── submission_base.py                   ✅ Helper
├── response_time_attention.pth          ✅ Model 1
└── weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt ✅ Model 2

Total size: 9.3 MB ✅ Within limits
Format: ✅ Compliant
```

## NEXT ACTIONS AFTER v5

1. Monitor TCN training progress
2. Check v5 results on Codabench (after 1-2 hours)
3. If v5 is good, start S4 and ensemble training
4. Create v6, v7, v8 submissions with new models

---

**Bottom line:** 
- v5 is READY - just upload it
- TCN script is READY - just run it
- No need to "redo training" for TTA
- TTA works at inference time with existing models

🚀 **UPLOAD v5 NOW!** 🚀
