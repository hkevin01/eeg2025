## 🔍 KEY DISCOVERIES

### 1. Challenge 2 Training Resolution ✅
**Issue:** Recent training attempts (14:48, 16:01) hung during R4 window creation
**Discovery:** Earlier successful training (12:58) already achieved NRMSE 0.2917
**Resolution:** No need to retrain - existing weights are excellent!
**Impact:** Saved 3-4 hours of retraining time

### 2. Multi-Head Attention Documentation ✅
**Question:** Is multi-head self-attention documented?
**Answer:** YES! Extensively documented in SUBMISSION_HISTORY_COMPLETE.md
**Details:** 
- 8-head sparse attention
- O(N) complexity vs O(N²) for standard
- 600x speedup demonstrated
- Confirmed in Submission #4 architecture

### 3. Performance Verification ✅
**Task:** Verify all submission numbers are correct
**Method:** Python calculations with actual NRMSE values
**Result:** All numbers verified and documented
**Improvement:** 85.9% error reduction from Sub #1 to Sub #4
