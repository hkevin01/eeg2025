# Challenge 1: Improvement Plan & Analysis

## Current Status
- **Previous Best:** NRMSE ~1.0 (basically predicting mean, not learning)
- **Target:** NRMSE < 0.5 (competitive submission)
- **Challenge 2 Success:** NRMSE 0.0918 (strategy proven to work!)

## Problem Analysis

### Why Previous Attempts Failed

1. **Wrong Model Architecture**
   - Used custom CompactCNN instead of proven EEGNeX
   - Challenge 2 showed EEGNeX works excellently (NRMSE 0.0918)
   - Lesson: Stick to proven architectures from braindecode

2. **NRMSE ~1.0 Indicates No Learning**
   - Model predicting constant (close to mean)
   - Possible causes:
     * Wrong data alignment
     * Inappropriate loss function
     * Learning rate too high/low
     * Data quality issues

3. **Lack of Data Augmentation**
   - Challenge 2 success showed augmentation is critical
   - Previous attempts had minimal or no augmentation

4. **Insufficient Regularization**
   - While dropout was used, no weight decay
   - No gradient clipping
   * No ensemble capability

## Improvement Strategy (Based on Challenge 2 Success)

### 1. Model Architecture ✅
**Action:** Use standard braindecode EEGNeX
- **Why:** Proven to work (Challenge 2: NRMSE 0.0918)
- **Parameters:** ~62K (small, prevents overfitting)
- **Dropout:** 0.5 (same as Challenge 2)

### 2. Data Augmentation ✅
**Implemented 3 techniques:**

| Technique | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Amplitude Scaling** | 0.8-1.2x random multiplier | Robustness to amplitude variations |
| **Channel Dropout** | 5% channels zeroed (30% of samples) | Prevent channel-specific overfitting |
| **Gaussian Noise** | σ=0.01 (30% of samples) | Robustness to noise |

### 3. Strong Regularization ✅
**Multi-layer approach:**
- **Weight Decay:** L2 penalty (1e-4)
- **Dropout:** 50% during training
- **Gradient Clipping:** max_norm=1.0
- **Early Stopping:** patience=15, min_delta=0.001

### 4. Adaptive Learning ✅
**Dual LR schedulers:**
- **ReduceLROnPlateau:** Reduces LR when validation plateaus (patience=5, factor=0.5)
- **CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts:** Periodic LR resets (T_0=10, T_mult=2)

### 5. Ensemble Capability ✅
- Save top-5 checkpoints
- Can combine predictions for better generalization
- Proven technique in competitions

### 6. Monitoring ✅
- Real-time train/val gap tracking
- Detect overfitting early
- NRMSE + Pearson correlation metrics

## Data Strategy

### Current Plan: Start Small, Scale Up

**Phase 1: Validation (R5 Mini)**
- Dataset: R5 mini release (~20 subjects)
- Purpose: Validate approach quickly
- Expected time: ~30-60 minutes
- Success criteria: NRMSE < 0.8

**Phase 2: Single Release (R5 Full)**
- Dataset: R5 full (~240 subjects)
- Purpose: Prove model can learn properly
- Expected time: ~2-4 hours
- Success criteria: NRMSE < 0.6

**Phase 3: Multi-Release (R1-R5)**
- Dataset: All releases (~1000+ subjects)
- Purpose: Maximum generalization
- Expected time: ~8-12 hours
- Success criteria: NRMSE < 0.5

## Differences from Challenge 2

## Expected Improvements

### From Previous Attempts (NRMSE ~1.0)

| Change | Expected Impact | Reasoning |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **EEGNeX Model** | -40% NRMSE | Proven architecture (C2: 0.0918) |
| **Data Augmentation** | -20% NRMSE | Increases effective data 3x |

**Expected Final NRMSE:** 0.3-0.4 (well below 0.5 target)

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Still Can't Learn (NRMSE ~1.0)
**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Check data alignment (stimulus anchors present?)
2. Verify response times are valid (not NaN, reasonable range)
3. Inspect data distribution (check for outliers)
4. Try different window parameters

**Solution:**
- Add detailed logging of data statistics
- Visualize sample windows and response times
- Check starter kit's exact preprocessing

### Issue 2: Overfitting (Train good, Val poor)
**Signs:**
- Train NRMSE < 0.3, Val NRMSE > 0.7
- Train/val gap > 0.3

**Solution:**
- Increase dropout to 0.6-0.7
- Add more aggressive augmentation
- Reduce model to smaller variant
- Increase early stopping patience

### Issue 3: Underfitting (Both train & val poor)
**Signs:**
- Train NRMSE > 0.6, Val NRMSE > 0.7
- No improvement over epochs

**Solution:**
- Increase model capacity
- Reduce dropout to 0.3-0.4
- Increase learning rate
- Check data preprocessing

## Conclusion

1. Use standard braindecode models (not custom architectures)
2. Apply comprehensive data augmentation (3+ techniques)
3. Use strong multi-layer regularization
4. Implement adaptive learning (dual schedulers)
5. Save top-k checkpoints for ensembling
6. Monitor train/val gap in real-time

**Confidence Level:** HIGH (90%)
- Same approach worked for Challenge 2
- Only difference is task-specific (response time vs clinical score)
- EEGNeX proven on EEG data
- Anti-overfitting strategy validated

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Start with mini dataset (quick validation)
- Phase approach (can abort if not working)
- Detailed monitoring (catch issues early)
- Fallback: Ensemble multiple approaches
