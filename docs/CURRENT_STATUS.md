# EEG Training - Current Status

**Date:** October 16, 2025 22:40

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Issue:** `arange: cannot compute length` error
**Root Cause:** NOT a GPU/ROCm issue - braindecode was inferring window sizes from corrupted event data (NaN durations)

## ��️ Solution Implemented

### Challenge 1 (Response Time):
- Added `add_aux_anchors` preprocessing
- Use explicit event mapping: `{'contrast_trial_start': 0}`
- Explicit window parameters (2s windows, 0.5s offset)

### Challenge 2 (Externalizing):
- Changed to `create_fixed_length_windows` (was using wrong function)
- 2-second non-overlapping windows for resting state data

### Device Strategy:
- **GPU first** with error handling
- **Fallback to CPU** if GPU fails
- **Parallel processing** on both (multi-core CPU or GPU acceleration)

## 📊 Training Status

```bash
# Check processes
ps aux | grep train_challenge | grep -v grep

# Monitor
bash monitor_training_enhanced.sh

# View logs
tail -f logs/train_c1_robust_hybrid.log
tail -f logs/train_c2_robust_hybrid.log
```

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

1. **Data Loading:** ~15-30 min (R1, R2, R3)
2. **Training:** ~1.5-2 hours with GPU, 4-6 hours CPU
3. **Target:** Improve from #47 (2.01) to #25-30 (1.5-1.7)

## 📝 Key Files

- `scripts/train_challenge1_robust_gpu.py` - Challenge 1 with GPU/CPU fallback
- `scripts/train_challenge2_robust_gpu.py` - Challenge 2 with GPU/CPU fallback
- `restart_training_hybrid.sh` - Quick restart script

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Wait for data loading to complete
2. Verify GPU activates during training epochs
3. Monitor validation scores
4. Create submission when training completes
