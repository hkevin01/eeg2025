## 💡 Key Insights

### The 1.9e-4 Problem
**Discovery:** At V10 C1 = 1.00019, only 1.9e-4 above baseline (1.0)

**Implication:**
- Maximum theoretical C1 improvement: 1.9e-4
- Architecture changes: HIGH RISK at this margin
- Variance reduction: LOW RISK, additive benefits

**Strategy Shift:**
- FROM: Try different architectures, bigger models
- TO: Ensemble + TTA + Calibration stack

### Variance Reduction Validation
**Calibration worked!**
- Expected: "maybe 1e-5 to 5e-5"
- Measured: 7.9e-5 improvement
- Validation: 1,492 samples, Ridge regression
- Conclusion: Even simple techniques help at small margins

### Training Speed Surprise
**Expected:** 41 hours for 5-seed training  
**Actual:** 11.2 minutes (2.2 min/seed)  
**Reason:** Compact model, efficient HDF5 pipeline

**Lesson:** Profile before optimizing - assumptions often wrong!

### Competition Format Matters
**Issues found during verification:**
1. Numpy vs torch tensor handling
2. Missing constructor arguments (SFREQ, DEVICE)
3. Wrong output shapes (squeeze needed)
4. Direct device conversion on numpy

**Lesson:** Test with EXACT competition format before upload!

### Power Outage Recovery
**Problem:** Training interrupted overnight  
**Solution:** Use best 2 of 3 checkpoints  
**Result:** 2-seed ensemble still excellent

**Lesson:** Don't need all seeds - 2-3 quality seeds sufficient

## 🚀 Next Actions

### Immediate
1. Upload V12 to competition
2. Wait 2 hours for evaluation
3. Check leaderboard results
4. Upload V11.5 for comparison

### Analysis (After Results)
1. Compare V12 vs V10 baseline
2. Compare V12 vs V11.5 (isolate TTA+calibration)
3. Identify which technique helped most
4. Document actual vs expected

### Future Work
**If V12 succeeds (C1 < 1.00015):**
- Try V13 with 6-7 seeds
- More TTA variants (5-7 transforms)
- Non-linear calibration
- Apply to C2

**If V12 shows minimal gain (C1 > 1.00016):**
- Accept C1 near ceiling
- Focus on C2 improvement
- Research top solutions
- Try different approaches

## 🙏 Lessons for Future Competitions

1. **Test competition format early** - caught numpy/torch issues
2. **Profile before optimizing** - training was 200x faster than expected
3. **Variance reduction works** - even at tiny margins (7.9e-5)
4. **Document everything** - helps with recovery (power outage)
5. **Understand the metric** - NRMSE normalized to 1.0 changed strategy
6. **Quality over quantity** - 2-3 good seeds > many mediocre seeds
7. **Verify exhaustively** - pre-upload verification saves competition attempts
8. **Focus on the goal** - README now competition-focused, not code-focused
