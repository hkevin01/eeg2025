## 📊 Document Counts

```
Total Documents: ~40 markdown files
- status/: Current training status
- plans/: TODO lists and roadmaps
- submissions/: Submission docs
- methods/: Technical documentation
- archive/: Historical records
```

## 🔄 Maintenance

### When to Update
- **Daily:** Update relevant status files in `status/`
- **After changes:** Update `memory-bank/change-log.md`
- **New features:** Add to `memory-bank/implementation-plans/`
- **Completed work:** Move status → archive

### Organization Rules
1. **Root:** Only README, requirements, and memory bank summary
2. **memory-bank/:** Core project memory (always current)
3. **docs/status/:** Current status only (archive old ones)
4. **docs/plans/:** Active plans only (archive completed)
5. **docs/archive/:** Everything completed/historical
