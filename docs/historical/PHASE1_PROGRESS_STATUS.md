### 2. Multi-Release Training Strategy (In Progress)

- ‚úÖ Residual reweighting (after epoch 5)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Data loading issues encountered (ROCm compatibility)

**Status:** Data loading taking very long time (~2+ hours)  
**Issue:** MNE/braindecode operations slow with ROCm workaround  
**Next Step:** Consider alternative data loading approach

---

### 3. Competition Compatibility (100% Complete)
- ‚úÖ `submission.py` has GPU optional + CPU fallback
- ‚úÖ No GPU-specific dependencies in submission
- ‚úÖ Tested device auto-detection

## üîÑ In Progress

### Training Status
**Challenge 1:** Stopped (data loading phase)  
**Challenge 2:** Stopped (data loading phase)  

**Observation:**
- Data loading from R1+R2+R3 is extremely slow with ROCm workaround
- MNE's `create_windows_from_events()` processes each subject sequentially
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours just for data loading
- This negates GPU speedup benefits

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Issues & Blockers

### 1. Data Loading Performance (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:**  
- ROCm workaround (monkey-patch torch.arange) works but is very slow
- Data loading: ~2-3 hours (same as full CPU training)
- GPU will only help training phase (~20-30 min)
- Net benefit: Minimal

**Potential Solutions:**
1. **Option A:** Pre-process and cache windowed datasets
   - Save processed windows to disk
   - Load pre-processed data directly
   - Bypass MNE/braindecode entirely during training
   
2. **Option B:** Use CPU-only training scripts
   - Stick with original non-GPU scripts
   - Accept 2-3 hour training time
   - More stable, proven approach
   
3. **Option C:** Hybrid approach
   - Load data on CPU (no workaround needed)
   - Transfer to GPU for training only
   - Modify scripts to separate data loading and training

**Recommendation:** Option C (Hybrid) or Option B (CPU-only for stability)

## üìã Next Steps Todo List

```markdown
### Immediate (Today)
- [ ] 1. Decide on data loading strategy:
  - [ ] Option A: Create data preprocessing script
  - [ ] Option B: Use CPU-only training (original scripts)
  - [ ] Option C: Hybrid CPU load + GPU train
  
- [ ] 2. Restart training with chosen approach

- [ ] 3. Wait for training completion (~2-3 hours if CPU)

- [ ] 4. Verify weights saved:
  - [ ] `weights/weights_challenge_1_robust.pt`
  - [ ] `weights/weights_challenge_2_robust.pt`

### Testing (After Training)
- [ ] 5. Test submission locally:
  ```bash
  python submission.py
  ```

- [ ] 6. Verify CPU compatibility:
  ```bash
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" python submission.py
  ```

- [ ] 7. Check weights load correctly:
  ```python
  import torch
  w1 = torch.load('weights/weights_challenge_1_robust.pt', map_location='cpu')
  w2 = torch.load('weights/weights_challenge_2_robust.pt', map_location='cpu')
  ```

### Submission (After Verification)
- [ ] 8. Create submission v2 zip

- [ ] 9. Upload to Codabench

- [ ] 10. Wait for scoring (~20 min)

- [ ] 11. Check new leaderboard position

### Documentation
- [ ] 12. Update improvement plan with results

- [ ] 13. Document lessons learned

- [ ] 14. Plan Phase 2 (if needed)
```
