- [x] Moved status files to `docs/status/` (9 files)
- [x] Moved guides to `docs/guides/` (5 files)
- [x] Moved methods to `docs/methods/` (3 files)
- [x] Moved summaries to `docs/summaries/` (3 files)
- [x] Moved old files to `archive/` (2 files)
- [x] Verified clean root structure

**Before:** 40+ files in root  
**After:** 11 essential files only

**Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Outcome:** Professional, clean, organized structure

## âœ… Navigation Documentation (Part 5)

### Master Index & Guides
- [x] Created `docs/INDEX.md` - Master navigation guide
- [x] Created `docs/ORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md` - Organization summary
- [x] Created `FINAL_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Overall summary
- [x] Created `docs/TASKS_COMPLETED_TODAY.md` - This checklist

**Files Created:**
1. `docs/INDEX.md` - Complete documentation map
2. `docs/ORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md` - Organization details
3. `FINAL_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Final status
4. `docs/TASKS_COMPLETED_TODAY.md` - Task checklist

**Time:** ~15 minutes  
**Outcome:** Clear navigation and reference documentation
