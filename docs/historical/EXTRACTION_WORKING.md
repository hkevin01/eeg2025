# ✅ P300 Extraction WORKING!

**Time:** October 16, 2025, 19:11  
**Status:** 🔄 **EXTRACTING P300 FEATURES**

---

## 🎉 Success! Third Fix Worked!

### Issue #1 (18:32): Missing event markers
- **Fix:** Added `add_aux_anchors` preprocessor

### Issue #2 (18:55): Wrong preprocessing pipeline  
- **Problem:** Used filtering (pick_types, clip, filter) instead of annotation pipeline
- **Fix:** Replaced with exact training script preprocessing:
  ```python
  Preprocessor(annotate_trials_with_target, ...)
  Preprocessor(add_aux_anchors, ...)
  ```

### Issue #3 (19:00): Wrong metadata access
- **Problem:** Tried to access `ds.rt_ms` which doesn't exist
- **Fix:** Use `windows_dataset.get_metadata()` and access `rt_from_stimulus` column

## 📊 Current Progress (19:11)

**Process:** ✅ **RUNNING FULL SPEED**  
- **PID:** 1432152
- **CPU:** 90% (maxed out - good!)
- **Memory:** 3.5% (1.1 GB - reasonable)
- **Runtime:** 1 minute 43 seconds

**Progress:**
- ✅ R1 loaded (293 datasets)
- ✅ Preprocessing complete
- ✅ Windows created: **21,948 windows!**
- ✅ Metadata injected successfully
- 🔄 **Extracting P300 from 21,948 trials** (current step)

## 📈 What's Happening Now

The extraction is processing ~22K trial windows for R1:

1. For each window (129 channels × 200 samples):
   - Average ERP across parietal channels (Pz, P3, P4, etc.)
   - Find P300 peak in 300-600ms window
   - Extract 6 features (latency, amplitude, area, onset, rise time)
   - Store with response time

**Expected Time:**
- ~0.1-0.2 seconds per trial
- 21,948 trials × 0.15s ≈ **55 minutes** for R1
- Then R2 (~20-25 min)
- Then R3 (~20-25 min)
- **Total ETA: ~2 hours** (completion around **21:15**)

## 🎯 Expected Output

### R1 Features (In Progress)
```
data/processed/p300_cache/R1_p300_features.pkl
- 21,948 trials × 6 features
- ~50-100 MB file size
- Response time range: ~200-2000ms
```

### After All Releases
```
Total trials: ~60,000-70,000 (R1+R2+R3)
Cache size: ~150-300 MB total
Features per trial: 6 (P300 characteristics)
```

## 🔍 Monitoring

**Check progress:**
```bash
./watch_p300.sh         # Live monitor (may not show tqdm progress)
ps aux | grep 1432152   # Check CPU/memory usage
tail -f logs/p300_extraction.log  # Watch log (tqdm may not appear in file)
```

**Check if still running:**
```bash
pgrep -f extract_p300
```

**Expected log output when R1 completes:**
```
   ✅ Extracted XXXX trial features
   💾 Saved to: data/processed/p300_cache/R1_p300_features.pkl

📂 Processing R2...
```

---

## ✅ Everything is Working!

The extraction is now:
- ✅ Using correct preprocessing pipeline (matches training script)
- ✅ Creating windows successfully (21,948 for R1!)
- ✅ Extracting P300 features at full CPU speed
- ✅ Will complete automatically in ~2 hours

**You can:**
- Let it run in background (using nohup)
- Close terminal (process continues)
- Check back around 21:15 for results
- Run `./watch_p300.sh` for status updates

---

**The hard part is done - it's working!** 🚀  
**ETA for completion: ~21:15** (2 hours from 19:11)

Next step: Verify P300 features and check RT correlation when complete!
