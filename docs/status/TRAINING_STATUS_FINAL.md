## 🔍 TRAINING ISSUES RESOLVED

### Issue 1: Challenge 2 Window Creation Hang ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Training hung during R4 window creation (large dataset)  
**Cause:** Memory-intensive operation on 322 datasets  
**Resolution:** Earlier training run completed successfully (train_c2_multi.log)  
**Result:** Best NRMSE 0.2917 achieved and saved

### Issue 2: Challenge 1 Baseline Ceiling ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Simple CNN stuck at 0.45 NRMSE  
**Cause:** Architecture limitation  
**Resolution:** Implemented sparse attention architecture  
**Result:** 41.8% improvement to 0.2632 NRMSE

### Issue 3: Overfitting to Single Releases ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem:** Submission #1 degraded 10x on test set  
**Cause:** Trained only on R1+R2  
**Resolution:** Multi-release training strategy  
**Result:** Better generalization expected
