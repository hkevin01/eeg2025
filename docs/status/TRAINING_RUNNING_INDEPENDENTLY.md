# ✅ TRAINING RUNNING INDEPENDENTLY

**Date:** October 17, 2025, 18:46
**Status:** 🚀 ACTIVE - Training in progress!

## Training Configuration

- **Model:** TCN (196,225 parameters)
- **Training Data:** R1, R2, R3 (11,502 samples)
- **Validation Data:** R4 (3,189 samples)
- **Max Epochs:** 100 (with early stopping patience=15)
- **Device:** CPU (stable for long runs)
- **Batch Size:** 16

## Independence from VS Code

Training is running in **tmux session** which means:

✅ **VS Code crashes won't stop training**
✅ **Can close VS Code safely**
✅ **Can close terminals safely**
✅ **Survives SSH disconnections**
✅ **Will run until completion or manual stop**

## How to Monitor

### View Live Training in tmux:
```bash
tmux attach -t eeg_training
# Press Ctrl+B then D to detach without stopping
```

### View Log File:
```bash
tail -f logs/train_fixed_20251017_184601.log
```

### Use Enhanced Monitor:
```bash
./scripts/monitoring/monitor_training_enhanced.sh
```

### Check if Running:
```bash
tmux ls
ps aux | grep train_tcn
```

## How to Stop (if needed)

```bash
# Kill the tmux session
tmux kill-session -t eeg_training

# Or attach and press Ctrl+C
tmux attach -t eeg_training
```

## Training Progress

**Epoch 1/100:**
- Initial loss: 2.069
- Current loss: ~0.018 (decreasing rapidly!)
- Status: Training ongoing

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Window Index Bug Fixed
**Problem:** `window_ind` returned as array `[i_trial, i_start, i_stop]`  
**Solution:** Extract first element: `i_trial = window_ind[0]`  
**Result:** ✅ Samples now extracted correctly (11,502 total!)

### 2. Metadata Extraction Working
**Problem:** `rt_from_stimulus` was in metadata but not being accessed  
**Solution:** Fixed indexing to use trial index  
**Result:** ✅ All 3696 response times extracted per release

### 3. Independent Training Setup
**Tool:** tmux (better than nohup or screen)  
**Feature:** Persistent terminal session  
**Result:** ✅ Training survives VS Code crashes

## Expected Timeline

- **Data Loading:** ✅ Complete (14s per release)
- **Epoch 1:** 🔄 In progress (~5-10 minutes)
- **Full Training:** ~1-3 hours (100 epochs with early stopping)
- **Best Model:** Saved automatically to `checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_competition_best.pth`

## Next Steps

1. **Let training complete** (1-3 hours)
2. **Evaluate best model** on R4 validation set
3. **Compare with baseline** (current: 0.2832 NRMSE)
4. **Integrate into submission.py** if better
5. **Upload v6 submission** to Codabench

## Training Will Stop When:

- ✅ Model converges (loss plateau for 15 epochs)
- ✅ Max 100 epochs reached
- ❌ Manually killed by user

## You Can Safely:

- ✅ Close this VS Code window
- ✅ Close all terminals
- ✅ Disconnect SSH
- ✅ Go to sleep / leave computer
- ✅ Work on other projects

**Training will keep running until completion!**

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Check status
ps aux | grep train_tcn

# View progress
tail -f logs/train_fixed_20251017_184601.log

# Attach to session
tmux attach -t eeg_training

# Detach from session (keep running)
# Press: Ctrl+B then D

# Kill training
tmux kill-session -t eeg_training

# List all tmux sessions
tmux ls
```

## Success Indicators

✅ Data extracted successfully: 11,502 + 3,189 samples  
✅ Model created: 196,225 parameters  
✅ Training started: Epoch 1/100  
✅ Loss decreasing: 2.069 → 0.018  
✅ Running in tmux: Session active  
✅ Independent of VS Code: Can close safely  

**🎉 Everything is working correctly!**
