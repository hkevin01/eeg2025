## üîç PRE-SUBMISSION CHECKS

### 1. Verify Weight Files Exist
```bash
ls -lh weights/*.pt
```
**Expected output:**
```
weights_challenge_1_multi_release.pt  (304KB)
weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt  (262KB or similar)
```

### 2. Check submission.py Configuration
```bash
grep "weights_challenge" submission.py
```
**Should load:**
- `weights/weights_challenge_1_multi_release.pt`
- `weights/weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt`

### 3. Verify METHODS_DOCUMENT.pdf Exists
```bash
ls -lh METHODS_DOCUMENT.pdf
```

### 4. Test Submission Locally (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# This will test the inference pipeline
python submission.py

# If it runs without errors, you're good!
```

---

## üì¶ CREATE SUBMISSION PACKAGE

### Step 1: Create submission.zip
```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025

zip submission.zip \
    submission.py \
    weights/weights_challenge_1_multi_release.pt \
    weights/weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt \
    METHODS_DOCUMENT.pdf
```

### Step 2: Verify Package Contents
```bash
unzip -l submission.zip
```

**Expected output:**
```
Archive:  submission.zip
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
    11234  2025-10-16 12:00   submission.py
   310000  2025-10-16 15:47   weights/weights_challenge_1_multi_release.pt
   268000  2025-10-16 16:22   weights/weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt
    94000  2025-10-15 10:00   METHODS_DOCUMENT.pdf
---------                     -------
   683234                     4 files
```

### Step 3: Check File Size
```bash
ls -lh submission.zip
```
**Should be:** < 20 MB (competition limit)

---

## üöÄ UPLOAD TO COMPETITION

### Step 1: Navigate to Competition Page
- URL: https://www.codabench.org/competitions/4287/
- Login with your credentials

### Step 2: Go to "My Submissions"
- Click "Submit" or "New Submission"

### Step 3: Upload submission.zip
- Select the file
- Add optional description: "Phase 1 - Multi-release training, R1+R2"
- Click "Submit"

### Step 4: Wait for Evaluation
- Evaluation runs on test set (R12)
- Takes 10-30 minutes
- You'll see results on leaderboard

---

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS

### Validation Scores (What we know)
```
Challenge 1: 1.0030
Challenge 2: 0.3827
Overall:     0.6929
```

### Test Scores (Projected)
Based on previous 10x degradation ‚Üí 2x improvement:
```
Challenge 1: ~1.2-1.4  (was 4.05, now much better!)
Challenge 2: ~0.4-0.5  (should stay similar)
Overall:     ~0.8-0.9  (competitive!)
```

**Note:** Test scores are typically slightly worse than validation, but our multi-release training should generalize much better!

---

## üéâ POST-SUBMISSION

### 1. Monitor Leaderboard
- Check your ranking
- Compare with other teams
- See if you made top 10!

### 2. Document Your Results
- Save test scores
- Update README.md
- Write summary of approach

### 3. Consider Improvements (If Time Allows)
**Only if you have days remaining AND score isn't satisfactory:**
- Phase 2 feature engineering
- Ensemble methods
- Hyperparameter tuning

**Otherwise:** Celebrate your success! üéä

---

## ‚ùì TROUBLESHOOTING

### If submission.zip is too large:
```bash
# Check individual file sizes
ls -lh weights/*.pt

# If needed, verify model loading without extra data
```

### If submission.py fails locally:
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Check required packages
pip list | grep -E "torch|numpy|scipy"

# Run with verbose output
python -u submission.py
```

### If test scores are much worse:
- This is expected to some degree
- Our val‚Üítest should be 2x (much better than previous 10x!)
- If > 3x worse, consider Phase 2
