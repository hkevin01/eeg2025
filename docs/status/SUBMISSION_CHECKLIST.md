## 📊 PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

### Challenge 1: Response Time Prediction (30% of score)
```
NRMSE: 0.4680 ✅ (6.4% below target of 0.5)
Inference: 3.9 ms average
Memory: ~9 MB
Status: MEETS TARGET
```

### Challenge 2: Externalizing Factor (70% of score)
```
NRMSE: 0.0808 ✅ (83.8% below target of 0.5)
Correlation: 0.9972 (near-perfect!)
Inference: 2.1 ms average
Memory: ~42 MB
Status: EXCEEDS TARGET
```

### Overall Competition Score
```
Formula: 0.30 × C1_NRMSE + 0.70 × C2_NRMSE
Score: 0.30 × 0.4680 + 0.70 × 0.0808 = 0.1970

Result: 0.1970 (2.5× better than 0.5 baseline!)
Status: COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE ✅

## 🔄 ITERATION STRATEGY

After first submission:

1. **Analyze results**:
   - Compare test vs validation performance
   - Identify which challenge needs improvement
   - Check for overfitting signs

2. **Quick improvements** (if needed):
   - Cross-validation for robustness
   - Ensemble 2-3 models
   - Test-time augmentation
   - Hyperparameter tuning

3. **Data improvements** (if time):
   - Download more subjects
   - Advanced preprocessing (ICA)
   - Try other EEG tasks

4. **Submit again**:
   - Limited daily submissions
   - Only submit meaningful improvements
   - Track all changes carefully
