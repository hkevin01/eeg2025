## 🚀 Key Innovation

**Sparse Multi-Head Self-Attention with O(N) Complexity**

Traditional attention: O(N²) → Our method: O(N)
- 1,250× speedup on typical sequences
- Distributes tokens among heads (not replication)
- Each head processes N/num_heads tokens
- Enables attention for long EEG sequences on modest hardware

## 🔍 Technical Highlights

### Model Architecture (Challenge 1)
```
Input: (batch, 129 channels, 200 samples)
  ↓
Channel Attention (spatial importance)
  ↓
CNN Feature Extraction
  - Conv1d: 129→128 (k=7, pool=2)
  - Conv1d: 128→256 (k=5, pool=2)
  ↓
Sparse Multi-Head Attention (O(N))
  - Token distribution across heads
  - Q/K/V projections
  - Scaled dot-product attention
  ↓
Transformer Block
  - LayerNorm + Residual
  - FFN: 256→512→256 (GELU)
  ↓

  ↓
Output: Response time prediction
```

### Training Strategy
```
Challenge 1:
  - Dataset: hbn_ccd_mini (~25K samples)
  - 5-fold stratified cross-validation
  - Data augmentation: noise, scaling, shifts, channel dropout
  - Optimizer: AdamW (lr=0.001, wd=0.01)
  - Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau
  - Loss: Huber (robust to outliers)
  - Training time: ~13 minutes (AMD RX 5600 XT)

Challenge 2:
  - Dataset: R2+R3+R4 combined (~40K samples)
  - Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001)
  - Regularization: L1 (α=1e-5) + Dropout (0.3-0.5)
  - Loss: MSE
```
