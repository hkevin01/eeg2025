## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Data Verification ✅
**Findings:**
- **Challenge 1 (HBN CCD Task):**
  - Dataset: `hbn_ccd_mini` 
  - Files: 256 CCD task files
  - Subjects: 20 subjects
  - Status: **Already using maximum available data** ✅
  - Note: "Mini" dataset actually has MORE data than full (256 vs 167 files)

- **Challenge 2 (Resting State):**
  - Available Releases:
    - R2 (ds005506): 150 datasets ✅
    - R3 (ds005507): 185 datasets ✅  
    - R4 (ds005508): 325 datasets ✅

**Progress:**
```
[1/3] Loading R2... (150 datasets) - In Progress
[2/3] Loading R3... (185 datasets) - Pending

Challenge 2: 0.2917 NRMSE (R1+R2, 2 releases)
Overall:     0.3720 NRMSE
```

### After Phase 1:
```
Challenge 1: 0.4523 NRMSE (unchanged - already optimal)

Overall:     0.33-0.36 NRMSE (improved)
```

### Improvement Goals:
- ✅ Maximum data utilization
- ✅ Improved cross-release generalization
- 🎯 Better test set performance (reduce validation/test gap)
- 🎯 Competitive with top teams on unseen data

## 🚀 Next Steps (After Training Completes)

### Immediate (< 1 hour):
1. ⏳ Wait for Challenge 2 training to complete (~90 min remaining)
2. 📊 Validate new Challenge 2 model
3. 🔍 Compare results with previous model
4. 📦 Create updated submission package (if improved)

### Phase 2 Options (Architecture Enhancement - 3-4 hours):
Choose based on Challenge 2 results:

**Option A: Submit Now (if results good)**
- Package current models
- Submit to competition
- Monitor leaderboard position
- Then proceed to Phase 2

**Option B: Continue to Phase 2 First (if marginal improvement)**
- Implement attention mechanisms
- Add transformer blocks
- Enhance regularization
- Then submit improved version

### Phase 2 Quick Wins:
1. **Attention Mechanisms** (2-3 hours)
   - Multi-head attention for temporal features
   - Channel attention for spatial features
   - Expected gain: 10-15% error reduction

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning** (overnight)
   - Set up Optuna optimization
   - Test learning rates, dropout, batch size
   - Let run overnight for 50-100 trials
   - Expected gain: 10-15% error reduction

Phase 1 Target:       0.33-0.36 validation
Ultimate Goal:        < 0.99 test (Rank #1)
```

### Key Insight:
⚠️ **Validation scores ≠ Test scores**
- Your validation: 0.37
- Test scores needed: ~0.95-1.00 for top ranks
- Focus: Generalization > Low validation scores
- Strategy: Multi-release training helps bridge this gap

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Data Strategy:
1. ✅ "Mini" datasets can have MORE data than "full" (curated selections)
2. ✅ Challenge 1 uses CCD task (R1), Challenge 2 uses RestingState (R2-R5)
3. ✅ More releases = better distribution coverage
4. ✅ Each release has constant externalizing scores (need multiple for variance)

### Training Strategy:
1. ✅ Start with maximum data before tuning architecture
2. ✅ Verify data quality (check for corrupted files)
3. ✅ Use cross-release validation for generalization
4. 🎯 Balance training time vs. improvement gains

### Competition Strategy:
1. 🎯 Submit regularly to gauge real performance
2. 🎯 Don't overfit to validation set
3. 🎯 Both challenges matter (can't sacrifice one for the other)
4. 🎯 Incremental improvements compound over time
