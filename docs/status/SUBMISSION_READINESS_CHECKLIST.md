## 📊 PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

### Challenge 1: Response Time
- **NRMSE**: 0.4680 ✅ (target < 0.5)
- **Weight**: 30% of final score
- **Model**: ResponseTimeCNN
- **Data**: 420 segments, 20 subjects
- **Status**: **COMPETITIVE**

### Challenge 2: Externalizing Factor
- **NRMSE**: 0.0808 ✅ (6x better than target)
- **Weight**: 70% of final score
- **Model**: ExternalizingCNN
- **Data**: 2,315 segments, 12 subjects
- **Status**: **EXCELLENT**

### Overall Estimated Score
```
Overall = 0.30 × 0.4680 + 0.70 × 0.0808
        = 0.1404 + 0.0566
        = 0.1970
```
**Estimated NRMSE**: 0.1970 (2.5x better than target!)

## 🔍 PRE-SUBMISSION VERIFICATION

Run these commands to verify everything one last time:

### 1. Test Submission Package
```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
python3 scripts/test_submission_quick.py
```
**Expected**: Both models load and run successfully ✅

### 2. Verify Package Structure
```bash
unzip -l submission_complete.zip
```
**Expected**: 3 files at root level (no folders) ✅

### 3. Check Package Size
```bash
ls -lh submission_complete.zip
```
**Expected**: < 20 MB (currently 1.8 MB) ✅

### 4. Run Comprehensive Validation
```bash
python3 scripts/validate_comprehensive.py
```
**Expected**: All 10 tests pass ✅
