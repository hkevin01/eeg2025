## 🎓 What Makes This Different

### ❌ Previous Training (Incorrect)
- Trained on random HBN BDF files
- Not using competition splits
- Not following starter kit patterns
- Mixed tasks and releases

### ✅ Current Training (Correct)
- **Using official `EEGChallengeDataset`**
- **Following competition splits (R1-R3 train, R4 val)**
- **Using official preprocessors (annotate_trials_with_target)**
- **Using official windowing (create_windows_from_events)**
- **Task-specific: contrastChangeDetection only**
- **Aligned with starter kit best practices**

---

## 📈 Expected Results

### Training Metrics
- Train loss: Should decrease from ~0.02 to ~0.01
- Val loss: Should decrease from ~0.03 to ~0.02
- Correlation: Should improve from 0.0 to 0.3-0.5
- Early stopping: Expected around epoch 20-40

### After Training
- Best checkpoint will have lowest validation loss
- Can integrate into submission.py
- Will replace current Challenge1Model
- Expected improvement: 10-30% better than baseline

---

## 🚨 What to Do When Training Completes

### Step 1: Check Results
```bash
# View training summary
cat checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_competition_history.json

# Check best checkpoint
ls -lh checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_competition_best.pth
```

### Step 2: Evaluate Performance
```python
# Load and test best model
checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_competition_best.pth')
print(f"Best val loss: {checkpoint['val_loss']:.6f}")
print(f"Epoch: {checkpoint['epoch']}")
```

### Step 3: Integrate into Submission
```python
# Update submission.py with new TCN model
# Replace Challenge1Model __init__ to load TCN checkpoint
# Test locally with local_scoring.py
```

### Step 4: Create Submission ZIP
```bash
# Create v6 submission with new TCN model
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
zip -r eeg2025_submission_tcn_v6.zip \
    submission.py \
    submission_base.py \
    checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_competition_best.pth \
    weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt
```

### Step 5: Upload to Codabench
- Go to: https://www.codabench.org/competitions/4287/
- Upload: eeg2025_submission_tcn_v6.zip
- Wait: 1-2 hours for results
- Compare: Against current score (0.2832 NRMSE)

## 🎯 Competition Alignment

### ✅ Following Official Guidelines
- Using official EEGDash dataset loader
- Using official braindecode preprocessors  
- Training on correct competition splits
- Task-specific for Challenge 1
- Proper response time targets

### ✅ Following Starter Kit Patterns
- Same data loading approach
- Same preprocessing pipeline
- Same windowing strategy
- Same evaluation approach
- Compatible model architecture

### ✅ Ready for Submission
- Model saves to checkpoint format
- Can be loaded in submission.py
- Under 50 MB size limit (2.4 MB)
- CPU and GPU compatible
- No external dependencies

---

## 💪 Confidence Level: HIGH

**Why we're confident this is correct:**
1. ✅ Using exact same tools as starter kit
2. ✅ Training on official competition releases (R1-R4)
3. ✅ Following recommended data splits
4. ✅ Task-specific training (contrastChangeDetection)
5. ✅ Proper target extraction (response times)
6. ✅ Validation on held-out release (R4)
7. ✅ Will test on R5 via submission (correct protocol)
8. ✅ Crash-proof system ensures completion

## 📞 If Something Goes Wrong

### Training Crashes
- Check log: `cat logs/train_real_20251017_182023.log`
- Look for errors in last 50 lines
- Training auto-saves emergency checkpoints

### Out of Memory
- Already using CPU (no GPU OOM possible)
- If system RAM issue, reduce max_datasets_per_release

### Data Loading Fails
- Verify data directory: `ls data/raw/`
- Check releases exist: `ls data/raw/ | grep R[1-5]`
- Verify BDF files: `find data/raw -name "*.bdf" | head`

### Need to Stop Training
```bash
# Graceful stop (saves checkpoint)
kill -SIGTERM 105017

# Force stop (if graceful doesn't work)
kill -9 105017
```

---

**Summary:** Training is running correctly on competition data (R1-R4) following official starter kit best practices. System is crash-proof and will automatically save checkpoints. Expected completion in ~2 hours.

**Next:** Wait for training to complete, then integrate best checkpoint into submission for Challenge 1.

**Status:** ✅ **ALL SYSTEMS GO!** 🚀
