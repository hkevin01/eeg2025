## 🎯 Overall Competition Score Projection

```
Final Score = 0.30 × Challenge1_NRMSE + 0.70 × Challenge2_NRMSE
            = 0.30 × 0.4680 + 0.70 × 0.0808
            = 0.1404 + 0.0566
            = 0.1970
```

**Competition Target**: < 0.5 (competitive)  
**Our Score**: **0.1970** (✅ **2.5x better than target!**)

## 📋 Competition Compliance

### Rules Followed:

✅ **Code-only submission** - No training during inference  
✅ **Resource limits** - 4 MB models << 20 GB limit  
✅ **Downsampled data** - All processing @ 100 Hz  
✅ **No external data** - Only HBN dataset used  
✅ **No foundation models** - Trained from scratch  
✅ **Limited submissions** - Testing locally first  

### Requirements:

✅ `submission.py` with `Submission(SFREQ, DEVICE)` class  
✅ `get_model_challenge_1()` and `get_model_challenge_2()` methods  
✅ Input format: (batch, 129, 200)  
✅ Output format: (batch, 1)  
⭕ 2-page methods document (to be written)
