## üéØ Key Findings

### What Worked (Submission #1 ‚Üí #2)
1. ‚úÖ **Multi-release training**: R1+R2 instead of R5 only
2. ‚úÖ **Increased diversity**: More subjects, more variance
3. ‚úÖ **Better generalization**: 1.1407 ‚Üí 0.2917 (74.4% improvement!)

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Using R2+R3+R4 (even more diverse than R1+R2)
- ‚úÖ Compact architecture (64K params)
- ‚úÖ Strong regularization (dropout 0.3-0.5, L1 penalty)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Validation NRMSE: 0.2970 (slightly worse than 0.2917)

## üîç Why Challenge 2 Might Be Slightly Worse

### Possible Issues

1. **Training Data Mismatch**
   - Submission #2 used: R1+R2
   - Current uses: R2+R3+R4
   - Question: Is R1 particularly important for R12 test set?

2. **Incomplete Training**
   - Log shows training stopped at ~Epoch 1-2
   - Best model from earlier run: 0.2970 NRMSE
   - May not have converged fully

3. **Model Capacity**
   - CompactExternalizingCNN: Only 64K parameters
   - May need more capacity for diverse data

4. **Data Balance**
   - R1+R2 had specific externalizing score range [0.325, 0.620]
   - R2+R3+R4 may have different distribution
   - Test set R12 may be closer to R1+R2 distribution

## üöÄ Improvement Strategies

### Strategy 1: Use ALL Releases (RECOMMENDED)
```python
Training: R1+R2+R3+R4 combined
Benefits:
  - Maximum diversity
  - Covers all possible distributions
  - Best chance to match test set
Expected: 0.25-0.28 NRMSE
```

### Strategy 2: Add Attention Mechanism
```python
Model: CompactExternalizingCNN + Sparse Attention
Parameters: ~100K (still very compact)
Benefits:
  - Learn long-range dependencies
  - Better capture temporal patterns
  - Challenge 1 showed 41.8% improvement with attention
Expected: 0.24-0.27 NRMSE
```

### Strategy 3: Ensemble Multiple Models
```python
Models:
  1. Trained on R1+R2
  2. Trained on R2+R3+R4
  3. Trained on R1+R2+R3+R4
Prediction: Weighted average
Expected: 0.22-0.26 NRMSE
```

### Strategy 4: Better Regularization
```python
Improvements:
  - Data augmentation (currently none for C2)
  - Mixup/Cutmix
  - Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA)
  - Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)
Expected: 0.24-0.27 NRMSE
```

### Strategy 5: Hyperparameter Optimization
```python
Search space:
  - Learning rate: [1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-3]
  - Dropout: [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
  - Architecture depth
  - Batch size
Expected: 0.25-0.28 NRMSE
```
