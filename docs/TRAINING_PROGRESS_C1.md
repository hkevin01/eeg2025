## ðŸ“ˆ Comparison

### October 17 (TCN):
- Model: TCN (196K params)
- Val Loss: 0.010170
- Metric: Loss only

### October 24 (EEGNeX - Current):
- Model: EEGNeX (62K params)
- **NRMSE: 0.3036** âœ…
- MAE: 1.21 seconds
- Correlation: 0.38
- Full metrics suite

**Note**: Different metrics, but NRMSE 0.3036 is excellent for response time prediction (0.1-5s range)!
