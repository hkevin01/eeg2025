## üéØ Comparison Strategy

### Why Two Submissions?

1. **v6a (Conservative):** Maximize known performance
   - Uses proven CompactCNN for Challenge 2
   - Low risk, solid baseline
   - Expected to perform well

2. **v6b (Experimental):** Test TCN architecture
   - Uses TCN for both challenges
   - Higher risk, potential upside
   - Real-world validation of TCN

### What We'll Learn

**If v6b > v6a:**
- TCN is better despite worse validation loss
- Val loss doesn't correlate with test performance
- ‚Üí Use TCN for all future submissions

**If v6a > v6b:**
- CompactCNN is better for Challenge 2
- Val loss is accurate predictor
- ‚Üí Keep CompactCNN, improve TCN training

**If v6a ‚âà v6b:**
- Models are comparable
- Use CompactCNN (fewer parameters)
- ‚Üí Focus on other improvements

## üìã Upload Instructions

### Step 1: Upload v6a (Primary)
1. Go to https://www.codabench.org/competitions/4287/
2. Click "Submit" or "My Submissions"
3. Upload `eeg2025_submission_v6a.zip`
4. Description: "Submission v6a: TCN (C1) + CompactCNN (C2)"
5. Wait for validation (~1-2 hours)

### Step 2: Upload v6b (Test)
1. Same competition page
2. Upload `eeg2025_submission_v6b.zip`
3. Description: "Submission v6b: TCN (C1) + TCN (C2) - Experimental"
4. Wait for validation (~1-2 hours)

### Step 3: Compare Results
1. Check leaderboard after validation
2. Compare v6a vs v6b scores
3. Note which performs better
4. Document findings for future work

## üí° Success Metrics

### Minimum Success (v6a)
- NRMSE < 0.20 (better than previous submissions)
- Rank: Top 15

### Target Success (v6a)
- NRMSE < 0.15
- Rank: Top 10

### Stretch Goal (v6b beats v6a)
- v6b NRMSE < v6a NRMSE
- Discover TCN advantage

## üìù Post-Submission Actions

1. **Document Results:**
   - Record exact NRMSE for both submissions
   - Note leaderboard rankings
   - Compare Challenge 1 vs Challenge 2 scores

2. **Analyze Differences:**
   - Which model performed better on C2?
   - Was validation loss predictive?
   - Any surprising results?

3. **Plan Next Steps:**
   - If v6b wins: Retrain Challenge 2 TCN better
   - If v6a wins: Keep CompactCNN, focus elsewhere
   - Either way: Look for ensemble opportunities
