# Competition TODO List - Part 4: Next Actions

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### 1. Testing & Validation (30 minutes)
```bash
# Create comprehensive test script
- Test both models with various inputs
- Measure inference time
- Check memory usage
- Verify output ranges
```

### 2. Write Methods Document (2-3 hours) ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
```markdown
Structure:
- Introduction (competition overview)
- Data (HBN dataset, preprocessing)
- Methods (model architectures, training)
- Results (performance metrics)
- Discussion (insights, limitations)
```

### 3. Final Testing (30 minutes)
```bash
# Before submission
- Test on fresh Python environment
- Verify all dependencies load
- Check submission.zip structure
- Validate file sizes
```

### 4. Submit to Codabench (15 minutes)
```bash
# When ready
- Upload submission_complete.zip
- Upload methods document (PDF)
- Monitor leaderboard results
- Document any issues
```

## üîß OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS (If Time Permits)

### Quick Wins (< 2 hours each)
- [ ] Try 3-5 different random seeds, average results
- [ ] Add simple ensemble (train 2-3 models, average predictions)
- [ ] Test-time augmentation (flip, noise)
- [ ] Feature visualization for one sample

### Medium Effort (2-6 hours each)
- [ ] Cross-validation (5-fold)
- [ ] Hyperparameter search
- [ ] Download more CCD subjects
- [ ] Advanced preprocessing (ICA)

## ‚è∞ TIMELINE RECOMMENDATION

### Option 1: Submit Now (Baseline)
- **Today**: Write methods document
- **Tomorrow**: Final testing and submit
- **Remaining 17 days**: Iterate based on leaderboard feedback

### Option 2: Improve First (Recommended)
- **Days 1-2**: Testing + methods document
- **Days 3-5**: Try 1-2 quick improvements
- **Day 6**: Submit improved version
- **Remaining 12 days**: Major improvements if needed

### Option 3: Major Iteration
- **Week 1**: Full cross-validation + ensemble
- **Week 2**: Advanced improvements
- **Final Days**: Submit polished version
