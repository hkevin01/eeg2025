## üö® CRITICAL PATH

**To reach Rank #1, we MUST:**
1. ‚úÖ Use maximum available data (Phase 1)
2. ‚úÖ Implement efficient attention (Phase 2)
3. ‚è≥ Optimize hyperparameters (Phase 3)
4. ‚è≥ Build ensemble (Phase 4)
5. ‚è≥ Extract domain features (Phase 5)

**Current Progress: 40% complete (2/5 phases done)**

## üîç MONITORING

### Challenge 2 Training:
```bash
# Quick check
tail -30 logs/challenge2_expanded_*.log

# Continuous monitoring
./monitor_training.sh

# Check if complete
grep "TRAINING COMPLETE" logs/challenge2_expanded_*.log
```

### Expected Output:
```
R2 loading complete... ‚úì
R3 loading complete... ‚úì
R4 loading complete... ‚úì
Total windows: ~X,XXX
Training started...
Epoch 1/50...
...
Best NRMSE: 0.25-0.28 ‚úì
```
