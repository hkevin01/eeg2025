## 🎯 STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENTS

### Phase 1: Maximize Generalization (Priority: CRITICAL 🔴)

#### 1.1 Multi-Release Training - EXPAND
**Current:** R1+R2 or Mini dataset  
**Improvement:** Train on R1+R2+R3+R4+R5 (ALL available releases)

**Why:** Top teams likely train on maximum data diversity
**Expected Gain:** -15-20% error
**Implementation:**
```python
# Challenge 1
releases = ['R1', 'R2', 'R3', 'R4', 'R5']  # Use ALL
train_releases = ['R1', 'R2', 'R3', 'R4']  # 80%
val_release = 'R5'                         # 20%

# Challenge 2  
releases = ['R1', 'R2', 'R3']              # All available
# Combine all for maximum variance
```

**Time:** ~2-3 hours per challenge  
**Risk:** Low - more data = better generalization

---

#### 1.2 Cross-Release Validation Strategy
**Current:** Single validation set  
**Improvement:** K-Fold Cross-Release Validation

**Strategy:**
```python
# 5-Fold Cross-Release
Fold 1: Train [R1,R2,R3,R4] → Val [R5]
Fold 2: Train [R1,R2,R3,R5] → Val [R4]
Fold 3: Train [R1,R2,R4,R5] → Val [R3]
Fold 4: Train [R1,R3,R4,R5] → Val [R2]
Fold 5: Train [R2,R3,R4,R5] → Val [R1]

Final model: Ensemble all 5 or best performer
```

**Why:** Ensures model works across ALL release distributions
**Expected Gain:** -10-15% error
**Time:** ~10-15 hours (can parallelize)

---

#### 1.3 Domain Adaptation Techniques
**Current:** Standard training  
**Improvement:** Release-invariant feature learning

**Techniques:**
1. **Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN)**
   - Add release classifier as adversary
   - Force model to learn release-invariant features
   
2. **Release Normalization**
   ```python
   # Normalize per-release statistics
   for release in releases:
       data_mean = data[release].mean()
       data_std = data[release].std()
       data[release] = (data[release] - data_mean) / data_std
   ```

3. **Contrastive Learning**
   - Learn features that are similar across releases
   - Different for different behaviors

**Expected Gain:** -5-10% error
**Time:** ~4-6 hours implementation + testing

---

### Phase 2: Architecture Optimization (Priority: HIGH 🟠)

#### 2.1 Challenge 1: Enhanced Architecture
**Current:** ImprovedResponseTimeCNN (798K params)  
**Improvements:**

1. **Temporal-Spatial Attention**
   ```python
   class AttentionResponseTimeCNN(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self):
           # Add multi-head attention over time
           self.temporal_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(
               embed_dim=512, num_heads=8
           )
           # Add channel attention
           self.channel_attention = ChannelAttention(129)
   ```

2. **Transformer Blocks**
   - Add 2-3 transformer layers after CNN features
   - Better long-range temporal dependencies
   - Top teams likely use transformers

3. **Multi-Scale Temporal Pooling**
   ```python
   # Instead of just global avg pool
   self.pool_max = nn.AdaptiveMaxPool1d(1)
   self.pool_avg = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool1d(1)
   self.pool_attention = AttentionPooling()
   features = torch.cat([pool_max, pool_avg, pool_attn], dim=1)
   ```

**Expected Gain:** -10-15% error
**Time:** ~3-4 hours
**Risk:** Medium - more complex = potential overfitting

---

#### 2.2 Challenge 2: Optimize for Externalizing
**Current:** CompactExternalizingCNN (64K params)  
**Status:** Already excellent (0.29), but can improve

**Improvements:**

1. **Slightly Deeper Network**
   - Current: 3 conv layers
   - Proposed: 4-5 conv layers (still <150K params)
   - Better feature extraction for personality traits

2. **Residual Connections**
   ```python
   # Add skip connections
   class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
       def forward(self, x):
           residual = x
           out = self.conv(x)
           out += residual  # Skip connection
           return out
   ```

3. **Batch Normalization Momentum**
   - Reduce BN momentum for better cross-release stats
   ```python
   nn.BatchNorm1d(channels, momentum=0.01)  # vs default 0.1
   ```

**Expected Gain:** -5-10% error
**Time:** ~2-3 hours

        quantiles = [0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9]
        loss = huber_loss(pred, target)
        for q in quantiles:
            loss += quantile_loss(pred, target, q)
        return loss
```

**Challenge 2: Externalizing**
```python

# Improvement: Robust Loss + Outlier Detection

class RobustRegressionLoss(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, pred, target):
        # Adaptive weighting based on residuals
        residuals = torch.abs(pred - target)
        weights = torch.exp(-residuals / residuals.median())
        return (weights * (pred - target)**2).mean()
```

**Expected Gain:** -5-8% error
**Time:** ~1-2 hours

---

#### 3.2 Advanced Regularization

1. **Mixup Augmentation**
   ```python
   # Mix samples from different releases
   lambda_ = np.random.beta(0.2, 0.2)
   mixed_x = lambda_ * x1 + (1 - lambda_) * x2
   mixed_y = lambda_ * y1 + (1 - lambda_) * y2
   ```

2. **Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA)**
   ```python
   # Average weights over last 10 epochs
   swa_model = torch.optim.swa_utils.AveragedModel(model)
   swa_scheduler = torch.optim.swa_utils.SWALR(optimizer, swa_lr=0.05)
   ```

3. **Gradient Clipping**

5. Optimizer: [Adam, AdamW, RAdam]

**Method:** Optuna or Ray Tune
```python
import optuna

def objective(trial):
    lr = trial.suggest_loguniform('lr', 1e-4, 1e-3)
    dropout = trial.suggest_uniform('dropout', 0.2, 0.5)
    # Train and return validation NRMSE
    return val_nrmse

study = optuna.create_study(direction='minimize')
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)
```

**Expected Gain:** -10-15% error
**Time:** ~6-8 hours (can run overnight)

---

### Phase 4: Ensemble Methods (Priority: MEDIUM 🟡)

#### 4.1 Model Ensemble
**Strategy:** Combine multiple models for final prediction

**Approach 1: Simple Average**
```python
# Train 5 models with different:
# - Architectures (CNN, Transformer, Hybrid)
# - Random seeds
# - Cross-validation folds

predictions = []
for model in models:
    pred = model(x)
    predictions.append(pred)

final_pred = torch.stack(predictions).mean(dim=0)
```

**Approach 2: Weighted Ensemble**
```python
# Weight by validation performance
weights = softmax([1/nrmse1, 1/nrmse2, 1/nrmse3, ...])
final_pred = sum(w * pred for w, pred in zip(weights, predictions))
```

**Approach 3: Stacking**

meta_features = torch.cat(predictions, dim=1)
final_pred = meta_model(meta_features)
```

**Expected Gain:** -10-20% error
**Time:** ~4-6 hours
**Note:** Competition may limit ensemble complexity

---

#### 4.2 Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)
```python
# At inference time
def predict_with_tta(model, x, n_augmentations=5):
    predictions = []
    for _ in range(n_augmentations):
        # Apply augmentation
        x_aug = augment(x)  # noise, scaling, etc.
        pred = model(x_aug)
        predictions.append(pred)
    return torch.stack(predictions).mean(dim=0)
```

**Expected Gain:** -3-5% error

        p300_amplitude = p300_window.max(dim=-1)
        
        # N200 component
        n200_window = eeg[:, :, 20:25]
        n200_amplitude = n200_window.min(dim=-1)
        
        # Latency features
        p300_latency = p300_window.argmax(dim=-1)

        self.temporal = [10, 11, ...]
        
    def extract(self, eeg):
        # Regional averages
        frontal_avg = eeg[:, self.frontal, :].mean(dim=1)
        
        # Hemispheric asymmetry
        left = eeg[:, self.left_channels, :].mean()
        right = eeg[:, self.right_channels, :].mean()
        asymmetry = left - right
