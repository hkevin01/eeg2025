## 🚀 Recommended: Phase 1 Implementation

### Why Phase 1 First?

1. **Proven Methods**
   - Multi-release training: Well-established
   - Huber loss: Standard in competitions
   - Residual reweighting: Used in winning solutions

2. **Quick Results**
   - 3 hours total
   - 25-30% improvement expected
   - Low risk of failure

3. **Foundation for Phase 2**
   - If Phase 1 → rank #25-30, continue to Phase 2
   - If Phase 1 → rank #20+, maybe stop here
   - If Phase 1 → rank #30+, Phase 2 definitely needed

### Phase 1 Changes Summary

**What changes:**
```python
# OLD approach:
- Train: R1+R2 (2 releases)
- Validate: R3 (1 release)
- Loss: MSE
- No reweighting

# NEW approach:
- Train: R1+R2+R3 (all 3 releases, 80% split)
- Validate: R1+R2+R3 (20% split)
- Loss: Huber (robust to outliers)
- Residual reweighting after epoch 5
```

**Files to modify:**
1. `scripts/train_challenge1_multi_release.py` → `train_challenge1_robust.py`
2. `scripts/train_challenge2_multi_release.py` → `train_challenge2_robust.py`

**Time breakdown:**
- Create scripts: 15 min
- Train Challenge 1: 60 min
- Train Challenge 2: 60 min
- Create submission: 15 min
- Upload: 10 min
- **Total: 2.5-3 hours**

## 💡 Key Insights from Integration

### What's INCLUDED from Advanced Guide:

1. **Huber Loss** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - WHY: More robust to outliers than MSE
   - WHEN: Phase 1 (tonight)
   - IMPACT: 10-15% improvement

2. **Residual Reweighting** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - WHY: Downweights noisy samples after warmup
   - WHEN: Phase 1 (tonight)
   - IMPACT: 5-10% improvement

3. **CORAL Alignment** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - WHY: Aligns feature distributions across releases
   - WHEN: Phase 2 (tomorrow)
   - IMPACT: 10-15% improvement

4. **Multi-scale CNN + SE** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - WHY: Captures patterns at multiple time scales
   - WHEN: Phase 3 (weekend)
   - IMPACT: 15-20% improvement

5. **Release-Grouped CV** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   - WHY: Prevents leakage, robust ensemble
   - WHEN: Phase 2 (tomorrow)
   - IMPACT: 10-15% improvement

### What's EXCLUDED and Why:

1. **P300 Features** ❌
   - Already confirmed useless (r=0.007)

2. **Domain-Adversarial (DANN)** ⏸️
   - Complex, implement only if CORAL insufficient
   - Save for Phase 4 if needed

3. **Quantile Regression** ⏸️
   - NRMSE metric expects point estimates
   - Median quantile ≈ Huber loss

4. **Sequence Context (GRU)** ❌
   - Competition evaluates trials independently
   - No context available at test time

5. **Subject-specific Normalization** ❌
   - Test set doesn't provide subject IDs
   - Can't personalize

6. **Large Transformers** ❌
   - Already overfitting
   - Need generalization, not capacity
