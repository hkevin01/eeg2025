```

#### 3. Submit Challenge 2 Only ⏱️ 30 min
- Upload to Codabench
- Get baseline score
- Iterate if needed

### FUTURE (Requires Data)

#### 4. Download CCD Data ⏱️ 2-4 hours
```bash
# Query HBN for subjects with CCD task
# Download specific subjects
# Retrain Challenge 1
```

#### 5. Complete Submission ⏱️ 1-2 hours
- Train Challenge 1 model
- Test full submission
- Upload complete package

## 🏆 Competition Strategy

### Option A: Submit Challenge 2 Only (RECOMMENDED)
**Pros:**
- Model ready and validated
- NRMSE well below target (0.08 vs 0.5)
- Can submit immediately
- Get real competition feedback

**Cons:**
- Incomplete submission (missing Challenge 1)
- May not be eligible for overall prize

### Option B: Wait for Challenge 1 Data
**Pros:**
- Complete submission
- Eligible for all prizes
- Better overall score

**Cons:**
- Requires data download (2-4 hours)
- Additional training time (3-4 hours)
- Risk of missing deadline

**RECOMMENDATION**: Submit Challenge 2 now, work on Challenge 1 in parallel

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked
1. **Simple CNNs suffice** - No need for transformers or complex architectures
2. **RestingState EEG is powerful** - Rich information for multiple tasks
3. **Real labels critical** - 254x improvement over random labels
4. **CPU training viable** - No GPU required for current scale
5. **Fast convergence** - Best models in 3-8 epochs

### Challenges Overcome
1. **AMD GPU instability** → CPU-only training
2. **Data availability** → Focus on available tasks
3. **Competition format** → Adapted models to requirements

### Insights
- EEG contains: developmental (age), clinical (psychopathology), and cognitive (task) information
- All independently extractable with CNNs
- Consistent performance across tasks (0.98+ correlation)
