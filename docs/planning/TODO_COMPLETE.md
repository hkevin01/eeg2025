## 📝 Notes

### Key Insights
1. **Cross-validation is critical** - CV NRMSE (1.05) differs from final (0.47)
2. **Data augmentation helps** - Prevents overfitting on small datasets
3. **Simple improvements work** - Projection layer + depth = big gain
4. **Test thoroughly** - Edge cases reveal potential issues

### Lessons Learned
1. Start with baseline, iterate methodically
2. Follow competition rules exactly
3. Test locally before submitting
4. Document everything as you go
5. Cross-validation reveals true performance

### Recommendations
1. Don't rush submission - 18 days remaining
2. Write methods doc incrementally
3. Submit strategically (limited daily slots)
4. Monitor leaderboard for insights
5. Keep improving until deadline
