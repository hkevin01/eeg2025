## â­• PENDING (Optional Improvements)

### Model Improvements
- [ ] Cross-validation for Challenge 1 (5-fold)
- [ ] Ensemble multiple models
- [ ] Feature visualization / saliency maps
- [ ] Test-time augmentation
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning

### Data Improvements
- [ ] Download more CCD subjects (if available)
- [ ] Advanced preprocessing (ICA artifact removal)
- [ ] Explore other tasks for Challenge 2

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Code documentation
- [ ] Type hints
- [ ] Linting cleanup

## ðŸš« NOT ALLOWED / OUT OF SCOPE

- Training during inference (prohibited by rules)
- Using test data for training (data leakage)
- Multiple GPU usage (limited to 1 GPU)
- External foundation models without documentation
- Unlimited leaderboard submissions (limited per day)
