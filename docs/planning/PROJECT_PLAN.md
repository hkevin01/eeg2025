# EEG Foundation Challenge 2025 - Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project implements a foundation model approach for the EEG Foundation Challenge (NeurIPS 2025), focusing on brain-computer compression and self-supervised learning for robust EEG analysis. The project leverages the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) EEG dataset to tackle two main challenges:

1. **Cross-Task Transfer Learning**: Transfer from Sustained Attention to Response Task (SuS) to Continuous Cognitive Demand (CCD) task
2. **Subject-Invariant Psychopathology Prediction**: Predict p-factor, internalizing, externalizing, and attention scores from EEG data

### Core Innovation

The project integrates compression techniques (predictive coding, wavelets, perceptual quantization) as augmentation strategies for self-supervised pretraining, creating robust, subject-invariant embeddings suitable for streaming real-time applications.
