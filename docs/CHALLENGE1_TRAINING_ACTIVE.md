# 🚀 Challenge 1 Training - NOW RUNNING!

## ✅ Status: TRAINING ACTIVE

**Started**: October 24, 2025
**Script**: `train_challenge1_working.py`
**Log**: `training_c1_working.log`
**PID**: Check with `pgrep -a python | grep challenge1`

## 📊 Current Progress

The training is now loading data from:
- ds005507-bdf: 184 subjects (Challenge 1 primary dataset)
- ds005506-bdf: 150 subjects (Challenge 2 dataset - same task!)
- **Total**: 334 subjects

This will extract response times from BIDS events files and create 2-second EEG windows.

## 🔧 What's Different This Time

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ Removed eegdash complications
2. ✅ Direct BIDS data loading (like Challenge 2)
3. ✅ Manual response time extraction from events.tsv files
4. ✅ Same proven anti-overfitting strategy as Challenge 2

### Approach:
```python
# Load EEG from .bdf files
# Extract response times from events.tsv
# Create 2-second windows (0.5s after stimulus)
# Apply same augmentation as Challenge 2
# Train EEGNeX model
```

## 📈 Expected Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Data Loading | 5-10 min | 🔄 IN PROGRESS |
| Training Epoch 1-10 | 15-20 min | ⏳ Pending |
| Training Epoch 11-50 | 1-2 hours | ⏳ Pending |
| Full Training | 3-5 hours | ⏳ Pending |

## 📊 Expected Results

Based on Challenge 2 success (NRMSE 0.0918):

| Metric | Expected | Target | Previous |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| NRMSE | 0.3-0.4 | <0.5 | ~1.0 ❌ |
| Improvement | 2.5-3x | ✅ | Failed |
| Status | Should pass | ✅ | - |

## 🔍 Monitoring Commands

### Quick Check
```bash
tail -30 training_c1_working.log
```

### Live Monitoring
```bash
tail -f training_c1_working.log
```

### Check if Running
```bash
pgrep -a python | grep challenge1
```

### Check Progress
```bash
grep -E "Epoch|NRMSE|Best" training_c1_working.log
```

## 📁 Output Files

When training completes, you'll have:
- `weights_challenge_1.pt` - Submission weights
- `outputs/challenge1/challenge1_best.pt` - Best checkpoint
- `outputs/challenge1/training_history.json` - Full training history
- `training_c1_working.log` - Complete training log

## 🎯 Next Steps After Training

1. **Verify Results**:
   ```bash
   grep "Best Val NRMSE" training_c1_working.log
   ```

2. **Test Submission**:
   ```bash
   python submission.py  # Should load weights_challenge_1.pt
   ```

3. **Upload to Codabench**:
   - Challenge 1: https://www.codabench.org/competitions/9975/
   - Challenge 2: Same platform (both ready!)

## 🏆 Success Criteria

- [x] Training started successfully
- [x] Data loading from both datasets
- [ ] NRMSE < 0.5 achieved
- [ ] Better than previous 1.0
- [ ] Weights saved
- [ ] Ready for submission

## 💡 Key Changes from Previous Attempts

| Previous (Failed) | Now (Should Work) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Custom CompactCNN | EEGNeX (proven) |
| No augmentation | 3 augmentation types |
| Weak regularization | Strong regularization |
| No early stopping | Patience=15 |
| Single scheduler | Dual schedulers |
| eegdash complications | Direct BIDS loading |
| Complex metadata extraction | Simple events.tsv parsing |

## 🔥 Challenge 2 Comparison

Challenge 2 achieved NRMSE 0.0918 using:
- Same model (EEGNeX)
- Same augmentation strategy
- Same regularization
- Same training approach
- Different label (externalizing vs response_time)

Challenge 1 should achieve similar success because:
- Same data quality
- Same preprocessing
- Same model architecture
- Same anti-overfitting measures
- Only difference: regression target
