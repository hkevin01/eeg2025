**Created:** October 19, 2025, 4:00 PM EDT  
**Last Updated:** Auto-updating via scripts  
**Competition Deadline:** November 2, 2025 (13 days remaining)

## 🎯 CRITICAL PATH TO SUBMISSION

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Stop inefficient training (no cache)
- [x] Create HDF5 cache creation script
- [x] Create SQLite metadata database
- [x] Create enhanced training script
- [x] Create monitoring scripts
- [x] Document infrastructure upgrade

### Phase 2: Cache Creation 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- [x] R1 cache created (11GB) ✅ VERIFIED
- [x] R2 cache created (12GB) ✅ VERIFIED
- [ ] R3 cache creation (IN PROGRESS - check tmux session 'cache_creation')
- [ ] R4 cache creation (PENDING)
- [ ] R5 cache creation (PENDING)
- [ ] Verify all 5 cache files exist and are valid

**Commands to check:**
```bash
# Check cache files
ls -lh data/cached/challenge2_*.h5

# Check tmux session
tmux ls
tmux attach -t cache_creation

# Check logs
tail -f logs/cache_creation.log
tail -f logs/vscode_crash.log
```

### Phase 3: Start Training 🔄 READY
- [ ] Wait for cache completion (R3, R4, R5)
- [ ] Start training in tmux: `./start_training_tmux.sh`
- [ ] Verify fast data loading (<30 seconds vs 15-30 minutes)
- [ ] Verify database logging works
- [ ] Monitor first epoch completion

**Commands:**
```bash
# Start training (after cache completes)
./start_training_tmux.sh

# Monitor training
tmux attach -t eeg_training

# Check training status
./check_training_status.sh

# Query database
sqlite3 data/metadata.db 'SELECT * FROM training_runs ORDER BY run_id DESC LIMIT 1;'
```

### Phase 4: Complete Training ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Let training run (5-10 epochs expected)
- [ ] Monitor via database queries
- [ ] Verify convergence
- [ ] Identify best checkpoint

**Monitoring:**
```bash
# Epoch progress
sqlite3 data/metadata.db 'SELECT epoch, train_loss, val_loss FROM epoch_history WHERE run_id = 1;'

# Best model
sqlite3 data/metadata.db 'SELECT * FROM best_models;'

# Training logs
tail -f logs/training_tmux.log
```

### Phase 5: Finalize Submission ⏳ PENDING
- [ ] Copy best weights: `cp checkpoints/challenge2_fast_best.pth weights_challenge_2.pt`
- [ ] Test submission locally: `python test_submission_verbose.py`
- [ ] Verify both challenges work
- [ ] Create submission package: `zip -j submission.zip submission.py weights_challenge_1.pt weights_challenge_2.pt`
- [ ] Upload to competition platform

### Phase 6: Repository Organization ⏳ DEFERRED
- [ ] Organize root files (AFTER training completes)
- [ ] Update file paths in code
- [ ] Clean temporary files
- [ ] Final documentation update

## 🚨 VS Code Crash Recovery

### When VS Code Crashes:

1. **Check Active Processes:**
   ```bash
   # Cache creation
   tmux ls | grep cache_creation
   tmux attach -t cache_creation
   
   # Training
   tmux ls | grep eeg_training
   tmux attach -t eeg_training
   ```

2. **Check Logs:**
   ```bash
   # VS Code crash log
   tail -50 logs/vscode_crash.log
   
   # Cache creation log
   tail -50 logs/cache_creation.log
   
   # Training log
   tail -50 logs/training_tmux.log
   ```

3. **Resume Work:**
   ```bash
   # Read this file
   cat TODO_TRACKER.md
   
   # Check overall status
   ./check_infrastructure_status.sh
   
   # Continue from last incomplete step
   ```

4. **Report to VS Code Team:**
   ```bash
   # Send this log file
   cat logs/vscode_crash.log
   
   # Include system info
   cat logs/system_info.log
   ```

## 🔧 Recovery Commands

### Cache Creation Stuck/Failed:
```bash
# Check if running
ps aux | grep create_challenge2_cache

# Check tmux
tmux ls
tmux attach -t cache_creation

# Restart if needed
./restart_cache_creation.sh
```

### Training Stuck/Failed:
```bash
# Check if running
ps aux | grep train_challenge2_fast

# Check tmux
tmux ls
tmux attach -t eeg_training

# Restart
./start_training_tmux.sh
```

### VS Code Crashed:
```bash
# Log the crash
./log_vscode_crash.sh

# Check what's still running
tmux ls
ps aux | grep -E "python3|train|cache"

# Resume work from todo list
cat TODO_TRACKER.md
```
