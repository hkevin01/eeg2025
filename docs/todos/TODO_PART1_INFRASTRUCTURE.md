## üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### Cache Creation (Current)
- [ ] R3 cache creation (üîÑ Loading data in tmux session 'cache_remaining')
- [ ] R4 cache creation (‚è≥ Pending after R3)
- [ ] R5 cache creation (‚è≥ Pending after R4)

**Monitor with:**
```bash
tmux attach -t cache_remaining
tail -f logs/cache_R3_R4_R5_fixed.log
```

**Estimated time:** 30-60 minutes total

## ‚è≥ PENDING (After Cache Completes)

### Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] Verify all cache files created
  ```bash
  ls -lh data/cached/challenge2_*.h5
  # Should show R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 (total ~50GB)
  ```

- [ ] Register cache files in database (optional)
  ```bash
  python3 -c "
  import sqlite3, os
  conn = sqlite3.connect('data/metadata.db')
  c = conn.cursor()
  for r in ['R1','R2','R3','R4','R5']:
      f = f'data/cached/challenge2_{r}_windows.h5'
      if os.path.exists(f):
          size = os.path.getsize(f)/(1024**3)
          c.execute('INSERT INTO cache_files (challenge, release, file_path, file_size_mb) VALUES (?,?,?,?)',
                   (2, r, f, size*1024))
  conn.commit()
  "
  ```
