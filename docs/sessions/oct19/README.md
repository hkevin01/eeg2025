- `SESSION_OCT19_FILES_CREATED.txt` - List of all files created
- `CRASH_LOGS_FOR_VSCODE_TEAM.txt` - VS Code crash log locations

## Key Achievements
✅ VS Code crash analyzed and prevented
✅ All processes moved to tmux (crash-resistant)
✅ Cache creation script fixed (correct API)
✅ Training started with R1+R2 data
✅ Multi-part documentation approach established

## Context
This session occurred after a VS Code crash that killed terminal processes during cache creation. The documentation uses a multi-part approach (small files) to prevent future crashes from large file operations.
