# 🔬 GPU Investigation - FINAL RESULTS

**Date**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ INVESTIGATION COMPLETE  
**Conclusion**: ❌ GPU training not possible on current hardware  

## 📊 Summary

After extensive testing with multiple ROCm versions (6.2.2, 7.0.2) and various workarounds, **GPU training is not feasible** on the RX 5600 XT (gfx1030) due to hardware limitations.

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ✅ Working Operations
- Basic tensor creation and operations
- Matrix multiplication  
- Memory allocation (small amounts)
- PyTorch GPU detection and device queries

### ❌ Failing Operations  
- **Conv1d/Conv2d operations** - Freeze or HSA aperture violations
- **Neural network forward/backward passes** - Depend on convolutions
- **Any machine learning training** - Fundamentally broken

## 🔧 Configurations Tested

1. **ROCm 7.0.2** + PyTorch source build - Failed (build issues)
2. **ROCm 6.2.2** + PyTorch rocm6.2 wheels - Partial success
3. **Environment variables tested:**
   - `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0` ✅ (basic ops only)
   - `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` ❌
   - `GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=50` ❌
   - Various memory limits ❌

## 📚 Research Findings

**GitHub Issue**: [ROCm/ROCm#2527](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm/issues/2527)
- Confirms **regression in ROCm 5.3+** for gfx1010/gfx1030
- **Memory access code changes** broke compatibility
- **No fix available** - AMD considers these "unsupported" architectures
- **PyTorch with ROCm 5.2** last working version (no longer available for Python 3.12)

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate (Competition)
1. **✅ Upload CPU submission** - Ready at 468KB
2. **✅ Continue CPU training** - Works but 10-20x slower
3. **✅ Document GPU limitation** - For future reference

### Long-term (Future Projects)  
1. **Hardware upgrade** - Newer GPU (RDNA3/gfx1100+)
2. **Cloud migration** - Use cloud GPU instances
3. **CPU optimization** - Maximize single-node performance
