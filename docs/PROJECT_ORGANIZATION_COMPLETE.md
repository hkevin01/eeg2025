## 🎯 Create Submission Package

**When training completes**, run:

```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025

# Create submission zip
zip submission_multi_release_final.zip \
    submission.py \
    weights/weights_challenge_1_multi_release.pt \
    weights/weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt \
    METHODS_DOCUMENT.pdf

# Verify contents
unzip -l submission_multi_release_final.zip

# Check size
ls -lh submission_multi_release_final.zip
```

---

## 📋 Root Directory Files (Clean)

**Active Files Only:**
```
/home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025/
├── METHODS_DOCUMENT.md          (source)
├── METHODS_DOCUMENT.pdf          ← FOR SUBMISSION
├── README.md                     (documentation)
├── TODO.md                       (task list)
├── submission.py                 ← FOR SUBMISSION
├── requirements.txt              (dependencies)
└── ...config files
```

**All other documentation in:**
- `docs/` - Current docs
- `docs/plans/` - Future plans
- `docs/archive/` - Old docs

## 🔍 Quick Reference

### Check Training Status
```bash
# Check if training is running
ps aux | grep "[p]ython3 scripts/train" | wc -l

# View latest NRMSE
tail -50 logs/challenge1_training_v7_R4val.log | grep "NRMSE"
tail -50 logs/challenge2_training_v8_R4val.log | grep "NRMSE"

# Monitor live
tail -f logs/challenge1_training_v7_R4val.log
```

### View Documentation
```bash
# Directory structure
cat docs/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md

# Current status
cat docs/FINAL_STATUS_FIXED.md

# Why R4 validation
cat docs/CRITICAL_ISSUE_VALIDATION.md

# Future plans
cat docs/plans/PHASE2_TASK_SPECIFIC_PLAN.md

# Task list
cat TODO.md
```

### File Locations
```bash
# Submission script
./submission.py

# Current weights
ls -lh weights/*.pt

# Methods PDF
ls -lh METHODS_DOCUMENT.pdf

# Training logs
ls -lh logs/*_v7*.log logs/*_v8*.log
```
