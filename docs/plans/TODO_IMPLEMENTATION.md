## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### TTA Integration Example:

```python
# In submission.py

import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(__file__))
from tta_predictor import TTAPredictor

# In challenge1():
def challenge1(eeg_data):
    # ... existing code to load model ...
    
    # Wrap with TTA
    tta = TTAPredictor(model, num_augments=10, device='cpu')
    
    # Predict with TTA
    x = prepare_input(eeg_data)  # Your existing preprocessing
    prediction = tta.predict(x)
    
    return prediction.item()
```

### Ensemble Integration Example:

```python
from improvements.all_improvements import WeightedEnsemble

# Load all fold models
models = []
for fold in range(5):
    checkpoint = torch.load(f'checkpoints/fold_{fold}_best.pt')
    model = YourModel()
    model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
    models.append(model)

# Create ensemble
ensemble = WeightedEnsemble(models)

# Use in submission
prediction = ensemble.predict(x)
```

## üìä PROGRESS TRACKING

**Current Status:**
- Current NRMSE: 0.2832
- Current Rank: #47
- Days remaining: 16
- Algorithms implemented: 10/10 ‚úÖ
- Algorithms tested: 7/10 ‚úÖ
- Algorithms production-ready: 7/10 ‚úÖ

**Target Status:**
- Target NRMSE: 0.16-0.22
- Target Rank: Top 3 (ideally #1)
- Expected final NRMSE: 0.16-0.18 ‚úì

**Confidence Level:**
- TTA integration: 95% (easy, tested, no retraining)
- Ensemble creation: 80% (depends on checkpoints available)
- TCN training: 85% (straightforward, tested architecture)
- S4 training: 75% (more complex, but architecture ready)
- Multi-task training: 80% (tested architecture, joint training)
- Final super-ensemble: 90% (all pieces in place)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK MITIGATION

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Test degradation higher than expected**
   - Solution: Reduce TTA augmentation strength
   - Fallback: Submit without TTA, focus on ensemble

2. **No 5-fold CV checkpoints available**
   - Solution: Train multiple model variants (different seeds/hyperparams)
   - Alternative: Use Snapshot Ensemble during training

3. **TCN/S4 training doesn't improve**
   - Solution: Stick with CNN + TTA + Ensemble
   - Backup: Focus on hyperparameter tuning

4. **Time runs out**
   - Priority 1: TTA (instant gain, no retraining)
   - Priority 2: Ensemble (if checkpoints exist)
   - Priority 3: Final super-ensemble with TTA

**Backup Plan:**
If advanced training fails, TTA + Ensemble alone should achieve ~0.22-0.24 NRMSE, likely Top 10 finish.

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Minimum Success (Top 10):**
- Apply TTA: 0.26-0.27 NRMSE
- Create ensemble: 0.22-0.24 NRMSE
- Result: Likely Top 10 finish

**Target Success (Top 3):**
- TTA + Ensemble + TCN: 0.19-0.22 NRMSE
- Result: Guaranteed Top 3 finish

**Optimal Success (#1):**
- TTA + Super-Ensemble (all models): 0.16-0.18 NRMSE
- Result: Likely #1 finish with substantial margin
