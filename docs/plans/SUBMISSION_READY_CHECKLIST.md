## 🚀 SUBMISSION PACKAGE CREATION

### Option 1: ZIP Package (Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025

# Create submission ZIP
zip -r eeg2025_submission_v4.zip \
    submission.py \
    checkpoints/response_time_attention.pth \
    checkpoints/weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt

# Verify package
unzip -l eeg2025_submission_v4.zip

# Expected output:
#   submission.py (~12 KB)
#   checkpoints/response_time_attention.pth (~9.8 MB)
#   checkpoints/weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt (~261 KB)
# Total: ~10.1 MB
```

### Option 2: Tar.gz Package (Alternative)
```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025

# Create submission tarball
tar -czf eeg2025_submission_v4.tar.gz \
    submission.py \
    checkpoints/response_time_attention.pth \
    checkpoints/weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt

# Verify package
tar -tzf eeg2025_submission_v4.tar.gz

## 📈 IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES (IF NEEDED)

### If Test NRMSE > 0.40:
```
Priority 1: Test-Time Augmentation
├─ Implementation: Average predictions across augmented versions
├─ Expected gain: 5-10%
└─ Time required: 1-2 hours

Priority 2: Ensemble Methods
├─ Train 3-5 models with different seeds
├─ Average predictions
├─ Expected gain: 10-15%
└─ Time required: 1-2 days

Priority 3: Hyperparameter Tuning
├─ Use Optuna for automated search
├─ Focus on learning rate, batch size, architecture depth
├─ Expected gain: 5-10%
└─ Time required: 2-3 days
```

### If Test NRMSE 0.30-0.40:
```
Strategy: Incremental improvements
├─ Fine-tune on all releases (R1-R4)
├─ Add advanced features (frequency bands, ERP)
├─ Optimize preprocessing pipeline
└─ Expected final: Top 3-5 finish
```

### If Test NRMSE < 0.30:
```
Strategy: Maintain lead
├─ Monitor leaderboard
├─ Prepare methods paper
├─ Document final approach
└─ Expected final: Top 1-3 finish! 🏆
```

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If ZIP creation fails:
```bash
# Verify files exist
ls -lh submission.py
ls -lh checkpoints/response_time_attention.pth
ls -lh checkpoints/weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt

# Try alternative packaging
tar -czf submission.tar.gz submission.py checkpoints/*.pth checkpoints/*.pt
```

### If upload fails:
```
1. Check file size (<100 MB)
2. Verify internet connection
3. Try different browser
4. Contact competition organizers if persistent
```

### If predictions fail on test set:
```
1. Check model loading in submission.py
2. Verify path resolution
3. Test with sample data locally
4. Review error logs from Codabench
```
