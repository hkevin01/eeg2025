# Training Plan with TTA Integration

## Current Situation Analysis

### What We Have:
1. **Trained Models (WITHOUT TTA):**
   - Challenge 1: `checkpoints/response_time_attention.pth` (9.8 MB)
   - Challenge 2: `checkpoints/weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt` (261 KB)
   - Validation: 0.2832 NRMSE (C1: 0.2632, C2: 0.2917)

2. **TTA Implementation:**
   - `tta_predictor.py` - Standalone TTA module
   - `improvements/all_improvements.py` - Contains TTAPredictor
   - TTA adds 5-10% improvement WITHOUT retraining

3. **Current Submissions:**
   - `eeg2025_submission_v4.zip` - Original (no TTA)
   - `eeg2025_submission_tta_v5.zip` - TTA integrated but uses OLD models

### What TTA Actually Does:
**TTA = Test-Time Augmentation**
- Does NOT require retraining
- Applied DURING INFERENCE only
- Takes 1 input → Creates N augmented versions → Averages predictions
- Benefits: Reduces variance, more robust predictions

### Misconception to Clarify:
❌ "Redo training with TTA integrated"
✅ TTA is applied at TEST TIME, not during training

## Two Separate Improvement Paths

### Path 1: Quick Win - Apply TTA (NO RETRAINING)
**Time:** Already done!
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**File:** `submission_tta.py`
**Expected gain:** 5-10% improvement
**Action:** Just submit v5 with TTA

### Path 2: Full Retraining with Better Methods
**Time:** 12-48 hours
**Status:** Not started
**Methods to integrate DURING TRAINING:**
1. Data augmentation during training
2. TCN architecture
3. Frequency features
4. Multi-task learning
5. Ensemble training

## What Should We Do?

### Option A: Upload v5 NOW (Recommended First Step)
```bash
# v5 already has TTA integrated
# Uses existing trained models + TTA at inference
# Expected: 0.25-0.26 NRMSE (5-10% improvement)
# Time: 0 minutes (already done)
```

### Option B: Train New Models with Advanced Methods
```bash
# Train TCN model (15-20% gain)
# Time: 4-8 hours
python scripts/train_challenge1_tcn.py

# Train S4 model (20-30% gain)
# Time: 8-16 hours
python scripts/train_challenge1_s4.py

# Train Multi-Task model (15-20% gain)
# Time: 6-12 hours
python scripts/train_multitask.py

# Then apply TTA on top of new models
# Total expected: 0.16-0.19 NRMSE
```

### Option C: Train Ensemble (10-15% gain)
```bash
# Train 5 variants with different seeds
# Time: 5 × 2 hours = 10 hours
for seed in 42 142 242 342 442; do
    python scripts/train_challenge1_attention.py --seed $seed
done

# Combine with WeightedEnsemble + TTA
# Expected: 0.23-0.24 NRMSE
```

## Submission Format Requirements

According to competition guidelines, submission ZIP must contain:

```
submission.zip
├── submission.py          # Main prediction script (required)
├── model1.pth            # Trained weights (any name)
├── model2.pt             # Trained weights (any name)
└── any_other_files.py    # Optional helper files
```

**Key Rules:**
1. Must have `submission.py` with functions:
   - `challenge1(eeg_data)` → float (response time prediction)
   - `challenge2(eeg_data)` → float (externalizing prediction)
2. Models can have any filename
3. Use `resolve_path()` to find files in different execution environments
4. Total size limit: Usually 100-500 MB

**Our v5 submission format:**
```
eeg2025_submission_tta_v5.zip (9.3 MB) ✅ 
├── submission.py                        # ✅ Has TTA integrated
├── submission_base.py                   # ✅ Helper file
├── response_time_attention.pth          # ✅ Challenge 1 model
└── weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt # ✅ Challenge 2 model
```

## Recommended Action Plan

### TODAY (Next 2 hours):
1. ✅ Verify v5 submission format - DONE
2. ⬜ Test v5 locally one more time
3. ⬜ Upload v5 to Codabench
4. ⬜ Wait for test results (1-2 hours)

### WHILE WAITING (Start background training):
```bash
# Terminal 1: Train TCN model
nohup python scripts/train_challenge1_tcn.py > logs/train_tcn.log 2>&1 &

# Terminal 2: Train ensemble variant 1
nohup python scripts/train_challenge1_attention.py --seed 142 > logs/train_seed142.log 2>&1 &
```

### AFTER v5 RESULTS (Based on performance):
- If v5 performs well (0.24-0.26): Continue with advanced training
- If v5 degrades: Adjust TTA augmentation strength
- If v5 improves a lot: Apply TTA to ensemble next

## Bottom Line

**Question:** "Redo training with TTA integrated"

**Answer:** 
- TTA doesn't need retraining - it's inference-time only ✅
- v5 already has TTA integrated with existing models ✅
- To improve further, we need to train NEW models (TCN, S4, Ensemble)
- Those new models will ALSO benefit from TTA

**Next Immediate Action:**
1. Test v5 locally
2. Upload to Codabench
3. Start training new models while waiting
