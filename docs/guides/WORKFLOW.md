# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow for the EEG Foundation Challenge 2025 project.

## Branching Strategy

We use a Git Flow-inspired branching strategy:

- **main**: Production-ready code, stable releases
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/***: Individual feature development
- **hotfix/***: Critical bug fixes
- **release/***: Preparation for new releases

### Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/ssl-pretraining`: New feature implementation
- `bugfix/data-loader-memory`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-security-fix`: Critical fixes
- `docs/api-documentation`: Documentation updates

## Development Process

### 1. Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eeg2025.git
cd eeg2025

# Create and activate environment
make env-create
conda activate eeg2025

# Install dependencies
make install-dev

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### 2. Creating a New Feature

```bash
# Start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Code Quality Standards

Before committing, ensure your code passes all quality checks:

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Run linting
make lint

# Run tests
make test

# Run security checks
make security

# All quality checks
make quality
```

### 4. Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(models): add transformer backbone architecture

fix(data): resolve memory leak in data loader

docs(api): update model architecture documentation

test(training): add unit tests for SSL training loop
```

## Pull Request Process

### 1. PR Requirements

Before creating a PR, ensure:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage is maintained (>80%)
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Code is properly formatted
- [ ] Security checks pass
- [ ] Performance impact is assessed

### 2. PR Template

Use the provided PR template that includes:

- Description of changes
- Type of change (bugfix, feature, etc.)
- EEG/ML specific considerations
- Testing checklist
- Performance impact assessment

### 3. Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: CI pipeline runs all quality checks
2. **Code Review**: At least one reviewer approves changes
3. **Testing**: Reviewer tests functionality
4. **Documentation**: Verify documentation is complete
5. **Merge**: Squash and merge to develop

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions and classes
- Mock external dependencies
- Achieve >90% code coverage
- Fast execution (<1 minute)

```bash
# Run unit tests
pytest tests/unit/ -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Integration Tests

- Test component interactions
- Use real data samples
- Validate end-to-end workflows
- Moderate execution time (<5 minutes)

```bash
# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

### Model Tests

- Validate model architectures
- Test forward/backward passes
- Verify gradient flow
- Check output shapes and ranges

```bash
# Run model tests
pytest tests/models/ -v
```

### Performance Tests

- Benchmark inference speed
- Memory usage validation
- Scaling behavior assessment

```bash
# Run performance tests
pytest tests/performance/ -v --benchmark-only
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration

Our GitHub Actions workflow includes:

1. **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, type checking
2. **Testing**: Unit, integration, and model tests
3. **Security**: Dependency and code security scans
4. **Documentation**: Build and validate documentation
5. **Docker**: Build and test container images

### Continuous Deployment

- **Development**: Auto-deploy to staging on develop commits
- **Production**: Manual deployment from main branch
- **Releases**: Automated tagging and release notes

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: New functionality (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Checklist

- [ ] Update version numbers
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Create release branch
- [ ] Final testing and validation
- [ ] Merge to main
- [ ] Create GitHub release
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Announce release

## Code Review Guidelines

### For Authors

- Keep PRs focused and small
- Write clear descriptions
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation
- Respond promptly to feedback

### For Reviewers

- Review within 24 hours
- Focus on correctness, clarity, and maintainability
- Test functionality when possible
- Provide constructive feedback
- Approve when ready

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Logic is correct and efficient
- [ ] Tests cover new functionality
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed

## Environment Management

### Development Dependencies

Manage dependencies carefully:

- Pin exact versions in requirements.txt
- Use requirements-dev.txt for development tools
- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability monitoring

### Environment Isolation

- Use conda environments for isolation
- Docker for reproducible builds
- Separate environments for different purposes

### Configuration Management

- Use Hydra for experiment configuration
- Environment variables for secrets
- Configuration validation
- Documentation of all parameters

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Check PYTHONPATH setup
2. **CUDA Issues**: Verify GPU drivers and PyTorch installation
3. **Memory Errors**: Reduce batch size or use gradient accumulation
4. **Slow Training**: Profile code and optimize bottlenecks

### Getting Help

1. Check existing issues on GitHub
2. Review documentation and examples
3. Ask in team discussions
4. Create detailed issue with reproduction steps

## Best Practices

### Code Organization

- Follow src-layout structure
- Keep modules focused and cohesive
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Separate concerns properly

### Documentation

- Write docstrings for all public functions
- Include usage examples
- Keep README updated
- Document complex algorithms

### Performance

- Profile before optimizing
- Use appropriate data types
- Implement efficient algorithms
- Monitor resource usage

### Security

- Never commit secrets
- Validate all inputs
- Use secure dependencies
- Follow security best practices
