## 📊 Expected Results

### Validation Performance:
- **Challenge 1**: NRMSE = 0.2816
- **Challenge 2**: NRMSE = 0.0918

### Test Performance:
- Expected similar or slightly worse performance on test set
- If significantly worse → investigate overfitting
- If significantly better → verify validation split

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "Module not found" error
- **Cause**: Missing dependency
- **Solution**: Check platform-provided packages
- **Fix**: Use only torch, numpy, braindecode

#### 2. "File not found" error
- **Cause**: Wrong path resolution
- **Solution**: Check file paths in submission.py
- **Fix**: Already handled with resolve_path() function

#### 3. "Out of memory" error
- **Cause**: Model too large
- **Solution**: Reduce batch size
- **Fix**: Current model is small (62K params) - should be OK

#### 4. "Timeout" error
- **Cause**: Inference too slow
- **Solution**: Optimize inference code
- **Fix**: Current code is efficient - should complete < 5 min

#### 5. Wrong output format
- **Cause**: Output shape mismatch
- **Solution**: Check expected format
- **Fix**: Already tested - outputs single value per sample ✅
