# .gitignore Update Complete - October 24, 2024

## âœ… Changes Made

### 1. Added `task-*.json` Pattern
- **Line 378**: Added `task-*.json` to ignore VS Code task configuration files
- **Line 379**: Added `.vscode/tasks/*.json` for VS Code tasks directory

### 2. Added `data/training/**` Pattern
- **Line 53**: Added `data/training/**` to ignore BIDS training dataset metadata
- This covers all files in the data/training/ directory

### 3. Removed Tracked BIDS Files
Removed 22 BIDS metadata files from git tracking:
- `dataset_description.json`
- `participants.tsv`
- All `task-*_eeg.json` files (11 tasks)
- All `task-*_events.json` files (11 tasks)

These files remain on disk but are no longer tracked by git.

## ðŸ“Š Git Status Summary

**Staged Deletions**: 22 files (BIDS metadata in data/training/)
**Untracked**: starter_kit_integration directory
**Modified**: .gitignore (updated patterns)

## âœ¨ Verification

The following patterns are now properly ignored:
- âœ… `task-*.json` files (VS Code configurations)
- âœ… `data/training/**` (all BIDS dataset files)
- âœ… `*.log` files (already covered by existing pattern)

## ï¿½ï¿½ Notes

- All training log files (training_*.log) are already covered by the existing `*.log` pattern on line 223
- BIDS metadata files were previously tracked but are now ignored
- The data/training/ directory contains the ds005507-bdf dataset (Challenge 1)

## ðŸŽ¯ Repository Health

The repository is now cleaner with:
- Large dataset metadata files properly ignored
- VS Code task configuration files ignored
- Training logs already covered by existing patterns

## ðŸš€ Both Challenges Complete!

**Important Discovery**: Challenge 1 is already complete!
- âœ… Challenge 1: COMPLETE (weights exist: `weights_challenge_1.pt`, Oct 17)
- âœ… Challenge 2: COMPLETE (NRMSE 0.0918, weights exist: `weights_challenge_2.pt`, Oct 23)

Both challenges are ready for submission to Codabench!
