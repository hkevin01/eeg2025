# Final Status - Training Restarted with Fixed Validation

**Time:** October 16, 2025 14:20  
**Status:** ‚úÖ BOTH TRAININGS RESTARTED WITH CORRECTED APPROACH

---

## üéØ What Was Wrong

### Issue #1: Challenge 1 - All Targets Were 0.0
**Problem:** All response times returning 0.0  
**Symptom:** Train NRMSE = 0.0, Val NRMSE = 0.0  
**Awaiting diagnosis:** Need to see debug output to confirm if `rt_from_stimulus` exists in metadata

###  Issue #2: Challenge 2 - Validation Set Had Zero Variance üö®
**Problem:** R5 validation set had ALL IDENTICAL externalizing scores  
**Symptom:** Val NRMSE = 20,000,000 (RMSE / 0.0 = infinity)

**Data Evidence:**
```
Training (R1-R4):  Range [-0.387, 0.620], Mean 0.203, Std 0.352 ‚úÖ
Validation (R5):   Range [-0.364, -0.364], Mean -0.364, Std 0.000 ‚ùå
```

**Root Cause:** R5 likely contains data from a single subject or all subjects have same score

---

## üîß Solution Implemented

### Changed Validation Strategy
**OLD (BROKEN):**
- Train: R1, R2, R3, R4
- Val: R5 (zero variance!)

**NEW (FIXED):**
- Train: R1, R2, R3 (75% of data)
- Val: R4 (25% of data)
- Both have diverse targets ‚úÖ

### Benefits:
1. **Both sets have variance** - can compute meaningful NRMSE
2. **Still cross-release validation** - R4 is different from R1-R3
3. **More realistic** - simulates held-out release like R12 test set

## üìä Current Training Status

### Challenge 1: Response Time Prediction
- **Log:** `logs/challenge1_training_v7_R4val.log`
- **Train:** R1, R2, R3
- **Val:** R4
- **Status:** Loading data...
- **Added:** Debug output to check `rt_from_stimulus` in metadata

### Challenge 2: Externalizing Factor Prediction  
- **Log:** `logs/challenge2_training_v8_R4val.log`
- **Train:** R1, R2, R3
- **Val:** R4
- **Status:** Loading data...
- **Expected:** Both train and val should have diverse externalizing scores

---

## ÔøΩÔøΩ What to Monitor

### When First Epoch Completes (~ 30-60 min):

**Challenge 1 - Check if targets are diverse:**
```bash
tail -100 logs/challenge1_training_v7_R4val.log | grep "DEBUG"
```
Expected to see:
- Training targets with variety (NOT all 0.0)
- rt_from_stimulus found in metadata
- Validation targets with variety

**Challenge 2 - Check if val has variance:**
```bash
grep -E "Range:|Mean:|Std:" logs/challenge2_training_v8_R4val.log
```
Expected to see:
- Training: Std > 0.3
- Validation (R4): Std > 0.2 (NOT 0.0!)

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Train NRMSE: 0.5-2.0 (not 0.0)
- ‚úÖ Val NRMSE: 0.5-2.0 (not 0.0 or 20M)
- ‚úÖ Both improving over epochs

## üìã Updated Todo List

```markdown
‚úÖ COMPLETED:
- [x] Identified Challenge 2 validation zero variance issue
- [x] Changed validation from R5 to R4
- [x] Added debug output for Challenge 1 metadata
- [x] Restarted both trainings with R1-R3 train, R4 val

üîÑ IN PROGRESS:
- [ ] Challenge 1 loading (R1-R3 + R4)
- [ ] Challenge 2 loading (R1-R3 + R4)

‚è≥ NEXT (30-60 min):
- [ ] Verify Epoch 1 shows diverse targets
- [ ] Verify NRMSE values are reasonable (0.5-2.0)
- [ ] Confirm both are learning (NRMSE improving)

üì¶ AFTER TRAINING (~3 hours):
- [ ] Check final R4 validation NRMSE
- [ ] Test submission.py
- [ ] Convert METHODS_DOCUMENT.md to PDF
- [ ] Create submission.zip
- [ ] Upload to Codabench
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Revised Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| **14:20** | Restarted with R4 validation |
| **15:00** | Epoch 1 complete (estimated) |
| **15:00-15:30** | Verify results look good |
| **17:30** | Training complete (estimated) |
| **18:00** | Submission ready (estimated) |

**Delay:** +2 hours from original estimate due to validation issue discovery and fix

## üéì Key Learnings

1. **Always check validation set variance!**
   - NRMSE = RMSE / std
   - If std = 0, NRMSE is undefined/infinite

2. **Print dataset statistics early**
   - Range, mean, std of targets
   - Catch issues before wasting training time

3. **Not all releases are suitable for validation**
   - R5 may be special/different dataset
   - Use subset of training releases for validation instead

4. **Cross-release validation still works**
   - R1-R3 train, R4 val is still multi-release
   - Tests generalization across different data

---

## üö® If Still Broken

### If Challenge 1 still shows NRMSE = 0.0:
- Check debug output for `rt_from_stimulus`
- If NOT_FOUND: field name is wrong
- If all values are 0.0: preprocessing failed
- May need to use different target field or fix preprocessing

### If Challenge 2 R4 also has zero variance:
- Fall back to random train/val split within R1-R3
- Use sklearn train_test_split on combined dataset
- Ensures both sets have variance

**Current Logs:**
- `logs/challenge1_training_v7_R4val.log` (current)
- `logs/challenge2_training_v8_R4val.log` (current)

**Previous Logs (for reference):**
- `logs/challenge1_training_v5.log` (NRMSE = 0.0 issue)
- `logs/challenge2_training_v6.log` (Val NRMSE = 20M issue)

**Documentation:**
- `CRITICAL_ISSUE_VALIDATION.md` - Details on zero variance problem
- `TODO.md` - Complete task list
- `TRAINING_STATUS.md` - Comprehensive status
- `METHODS_DOCUMENT.md` - Competition methods

## ‚úÖ Next Actions

1. **Wait 30-60 minutes** for Epoch 1 to complete
2. **Check debug output** to verify targets are diverse
3. **Monitor NRMSE** - should be 0.5-2.0 range, not 0.0 or 20M
4. **If good:** Let training complete (~3 hours)
5. **If still broken:** Investigate and fix based on debug output

---

**Bottom Line:** We identified a critical validation issue (zero variance in R5) and fixed it by using R4 for validation instead. Training is now restarted with the correct approach. Expecting meaningful results in ~30 minutes when Epoch 1 completes.
