### üîÑ Task 2: Monitor Training Progress (IN PROGRESS)

#### Phase 1: Data Loading (Current - Est. 15-30 min)
- [ ] Monitor data loading progress
  ```bash
  tail -f logs/train_c1_robust_hybrid.log
  ```
- [ ] Watch for "Loading R1... R2... R3..." completion
- [ ] Check for any errors during data loading
- [ ] Verify no "arange" errors appear

**Expected Output:**
```
üì¶ Loading ALL releases (R1+R2+R3)...
  [1/3] Loading R1... ‚úì (X trials, Ys)
  [2/3] Loading R2... ‚úì (X trials, Ys)
  [3/3] Loading R3... ‚úì (X trials, Ys)
‚úÖ Total: XXXXX trials across 3 releases
üìä Splitting dataset:
  Train: XXXXX samples (80%)
  Val: XXXXX samples (20%)
```

**Check Every:** 5 minutes  
**Commands:**
```bash
# Quick check
tail -20 logs/train_c1_robust_hybrid.log

# Watch live
watch -n 30 'tail -20 logs/train_c1_robust_hybrid.log'

# Check for errors
grep -i "error\|exception\|failed" logs/train_c1_robust_hybrid.log
```

#### Phase 2: Training Epochs (Est. 1.5-2 hours after data loads)
- [ ] Confirm training started ("Epoch 1/50")
- [ ] Monitor GPU utilization (should be 70-95%)
- [ ] Check temperature (should be 60-80¬∞C)
- [ ] Watch validation NRMSE trends
- [ ] Verify no memory errors

**Expected Output:**
```
üöÄ Starting training (50 epochs max, patience=15)
   Device: cuda
   Mixed Precision: True
   Huber loss + Residual reweighting after epoch 5

Epoch   1/50 | Train Loss: 1.2345 | Val NRMSE: 0.8500 | LR: 0.00100 | Time: 45s | Best ‚úÖ
Epoch   2/50 | Train Loss: 0.9876 | Val NRMSE: 0.7800 | LR: 0.00098 | Time: 43s | Best ‚úÖ
...
```

**Monitor GPU:**
```bash
# Real-time GPU monitoring
watch -n 2 rocm-smi

# Expected during training:
# GPU use: 70-95%
# Temperature: 60-80¬∞C
# Power: 80-120W
# VRAM: 3-5GB / 6GB
```

**Check Every:** 10 minutes

#### Phase 3: Training Complete (Est. 22:40-23:40)
- [ ] Verify training completed successfully
- [ ] Check final validation NRMSE
- [ ] Confirm weights saved
- [ ] Review early stopping info

**Expected Output:**
```
Best Epoch: XX/50
Best Val NRMSE: 0.XXXX

‚úÖ Training complete!
   Total time: XX minutes
   Best validation NRMSE: 0.XXXX
   
Weights saved: weights/weights_challenge_1_robust.pt
```

---

### üîç Task 3: Verify Weights Saved

After training completes:

- [ ] **Challenge 1 weights exist:**
  ```bash
  ls -lh weights/weights_challenge_1_robust.pt
  # Expected: ~300-400 KB
  ```

- [ ] **Challenge 2 weights exist:**
  ```bash
  ls -lh weights/weights_challenge_2_robust.pt
  # Expected: ~300-400 KB
  ```

- [ ] **Weights are loadable:**
  ```bash
  python -c "import torch; w=torch.load('weights/weights_challenge_1_robust.pt', map_location='cpu'); print('‚úÖ Challenge 1 weights OK')"
  python -c "import torch; w=torch.load('weights/weights_challenge_2_robust.pt', map_location='cpu'); print('‚úÖ Challenge 2 weights OK')"
  ```

- [ ] **Extract final validation scores:**
  ```bash
  grep "Best Val NRMSE" logs/train_c1_robust_hybrid.log
  grep "Best Val NRMSE" logs/train_c2_robust_hybrid.log
  ```

## üìä Monitoring Commands Reference

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# Are processes running?
ps aux | grep "train_challenge.*_robust_gpu" | grep -v grep

# Quick log peek
echo "=== Challenge 1 ===" && tail -10 logs/train_c1_robust_hybrid.log
echo "=== Challenge 2 ===" && tail -10 logs/train_c2_robust_hybrid.log

# GPU status
rocm-smi --showuse --showtemp --showpower
```

### Detailed Monitoring
```bash
# Enhanced monitor (shows GPU details)
bash monitor_training_enhanced.sh

# Watch GPU live
watch -n 2 'rocm-smi --showuse --showtemp --showpower'

# Follow logs
tail -f logs/train_c1_robust_hybrid.log
# (Ctrl+C to stop)
```

### Check for Issues
```bash
# Search for errors
grep -i "error\|exception\|traceback\|failed" logs/train_c1_robust_hybrid.log
grep -i "error\|exception\|traceback\|failed" logs/train_c2_robust_hybrid.log

# Check if processes died
ps aux | grep train_challenge

# Check exit codes (if processes stopped)
echo "C1:" && tail -50 logs/train_c1_robust_hybrid.log | grep -i "complete\|error\|exception"
echo "C2:" && tail -50 logs/train_c2_robust_hybrid.log | grep -i "complete\|error\|exception"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If Data Loading Hangs
```bash
# Check last log entry
tail -5 logs/train_c1_robust_hybrid.log

# If stuck > 30 min, check process
ps aux | grep train_challenge | grep -v grep

# Check for zombie process
ps aux | grep -E "train_challenge.*Z"

# If needed, restart
bash restart_training_hybrid.sh
```

### If GPU Not Being Used
```bash
# Check device detection
grep "Device:" logs/train_c1_robust_hybrid.log

# Should show:
# Device: cuda

# If shows "Device: cpu", check PyTorch
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

### If Out of Memory
```bash
# Check VRAM usage
rocm-smi --showmeminfo

# If OOM, reduce batch size in scripts
# Edit: batch_size = 16  # or 8
```

## üìù Notes

**Approach:** Hybrid CPU/GPU
- ‚úÖ Data loading on CPU (stable, no ROCm issues)
- ‚úÖ Training on GPU (fast, 4-5x speedup)
- ‚úÖ No monkey-patching needed
- ‚úÖ Natural PyTorch behavior

**Expected Benefits:**
- Stable data loading (no arange errors)
- Fast training (GPU acceleration)
- Best of both worlds

**Next Steps After Completion:**
1. Verify weights saved
2. Test submission locally
3. Create submission v2 zip
4. Upload to Codabench
5. Check leaderboard position
