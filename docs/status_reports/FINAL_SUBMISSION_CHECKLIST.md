# 🎯 Final Submission Checklist - October 27, 2025

## ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Train 3× CompactCNN models (seeds 42, 123, 456)
- [x] Evaluate ensemble on validation set
- [x] Create ensemble submission
- [x] Create single best model submission
- [x] Test both submissions locally
- [x] Analyze results (ensemble worse than single)
- [x] Document complete workflow

## 📦 SUBMISSIONS READY

### Recommended Upload Order

**1. submission_v9_single_best.zip (0.98 MB)** ✅ **UPLOAD FIRST**
- Best validation: Pearson r = 0.0211
- CompactCNN seed 456 (stopped epoch 5)
- Expected: ~1.0-1.1 score

**2. submission_v9_ensemble_final.zip (1.6 MB)**
- 3× CompactCNN ensemble
- Validation: Pearson r = 0.0179 (worse than single)
- Expected: ~1.0-1.2 score
- Upload to test ensemble hypothesis

**3. submission_tcn_v8.zip (2.9 MB)**
- TCN architecture baseline
- Expected: ~0.9-1.1 score
- Confirms path in decision tree

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### Scenario 1: v9_single ≈ quick_fix (~1.0-1.1)
- ✅ CompactCNN architecture confirmed
- ✅ Training improvements didn't help
- ❌ Low Pearson r concern validated
- **Next**: Try different approach (transformer, different loss, etc.)

### Scenario 2: v9_single > quick_fix (< 1.0)
- ✅ More data + augmentation helped!
- ✅ Training improvements worked
- **Next**: Push further (more epochs, hyperparameter tuning)

### Scenario 3: v9_single < quick_fix (> 1.1)
- ❌ Training degraded performance
- ❌ Augmentation too aggressive
- **Next**: Revert to quick_fix approach, tune carefully

### Ensemble vs Single Comparison
- **If ensemble better**: Models complementary despite validation
- **If ensemble worse**: Confirms validation findings

## 🎯 Next Actions After Scores

```markdown
[ ] Upload v9_single_best.zip → Record score
[ ] Upload v9_ensemble_final.zip → Record score
[ ] Upload v8_tcn.zip → Record score

[ ] Compare:
    - v9_single vs quick_fix (training improvement?)
    - v9_ensemble vs v9_single (ensemble benefit?)
    - CompactCNN vs TCN (architecture comparison?)

[ ] Update strategy based on results
[ ] Document findings
```

## 📝 Notes

### Training Insights
- Models converged quickly (5-25 epochs)
- Low Pearson r (~0.02) concerning
- Ensemble didn't help (models too similar)
- Seed 456 best despite stopping earliest

### Architecture Insights
- CompactCNN (75K params) proven with quick_fix
- Simple architecture > complex (SAM failed)
- More parameters ≠ better performance

### Data Insights
- R1-R3 training: 24,467 samples
- R4 validation: 16,604 samples
- Total: 41,071 samples used
- May need different data splits or more data
