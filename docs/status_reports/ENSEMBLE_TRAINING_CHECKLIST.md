# ðŸŽ¯ Ensemble Training Checklist

## Quick Reference - Next Actions

### âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] Analyze best submission (quick_fix: 1.01)
- [x] Stop failing SAM training
- [x] Create v8 TCN submission
- [x] Analyze Path B strategy
- [x] Create training script (~500 lines)
- [x] Implement data loading (H5 files)
- [x] Create ensemble submission script
- [x] Test training (1 epoch - passed)
- [x] Fix shape handling
- [x] Document everything

### ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS / TODO

#### Phase 2: Upload v8 (5 minutes)
- [ ] Upload `submission_tcn_v8.zip` to competition
- [ ] Record v8 score when available
- [ ] Confirm path (A/B/C) based on score

#### Phase 3: Training (6-12 hours) ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT**
- [ ] Start training: `python training/train_compact_ensemble.py`
- [ ] Monitor progress (3 models Ã— 2-4 hours each)
- [ ] Verify 3 checkpoints created

#### Phase 4: Ensemble Creation (10 minutes)
- [ ] Run: `python create_ensemble_submission.py`
- [ ] Verify `submission_v9_ensemble_final.zip` created
- [ ] Test locally: `python submission.py`

#### Phase 5: Submit & Validate
- [ ] Upload `submission_v9_ensemble_final.zip`
- [ ] Wait for score
- [ ] Compare vs 1.01 (target: 0.75-0.90)

## Files Ready to Use

**Training:**
```bash
python training/train_compact_ensemble.py
# Outputs: checkpoints/compact_ensemble/*.pth
```

**After Training:**
```bash
python create_ensemble_submission.py
# Outputs: submission_v9_ensemble_final.zip
```

**Upload:**
```bash
# Upload: submission_tcn_v8.zip (ready now)
# Upload: submission_v9_ensemble_final.zip (after training)
```
