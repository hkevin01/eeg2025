# 🚀 Training Infrastructure Ready - October 26, 2024

## ✅ Status: READY TO TRAIN

All infrastructure is complete and tested. Ready to start 3x CompactCNN ensemble training.

---

## 📊 Analysis Complete

### Best Submission Analysis
- **submission_quick_fix.zip**: Score **1.01** (current best)
  - CompactResponseTimeCNN (75K params) + EEGNeX (170K params)
  - Simple architecture beats complexity
  - Used limited cached data only
  - No augmentation

### Failed Submission Comparison
- **SAM v7**: Score **1.82** (80% worse)
  - ImprovedEEGModel (168K params)
  - More complex but overfitted
  - Proves: **Simplicity > Complexity** for this task

### Key Learning
**Architecture is NOT the bottleneck** - if simple (75K) and complex (196K) models
plateau at similar scores (~1.0), the problem is DATA and TRAINING, not architecture.

---

## 🎯 Strategy: Path B - Better Training

Instead of creating complex ensemble (CompactCNN + TCN with incompatible architectures),
we focus on better training with the PROVEN CompactCNN architecture.

### What We're Doing:
**Train 3× CompactCNN with improvements:**
- Same proven architecture (75K params, score 1.01)
- Use ALL available data (R1+R2+R3 = 24,467 samples)
- Validate on R4 (16,604 samples)
- Data augmentation (time jitter ±10ms, noise σ=0.02, channel dropout 5%)
- 3 models with different seeds (42, 123, 456)
- Ensemble by averaging predictions

### Expected Improvement:
- **Current**: 1.01 (single model, limited data, no augmentation)
- **Target**: 0.75-0.90 (15-25% improvement)

Breakdown:
- More data (R1-R3 vs cached only): **+5-10%**
- Data augmentation: **+5-8%**
- Ensemble (3 models): **+5-7%**
- Better training (Huber loss, early stopping): **+3-5%**
- **Total: +18-30% improvement**

## 📋 TODO List

```markdown
PHASE 1: SETUP & PREPARATION ✅
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ Analyze quick_fix success (CompactCNN 1.01)
✅ Stop failing training (PID 1847269)
✅ Create v8 TCN submission
✅ Analyze Path B (ensemble vs training)
✅ Create training script (train_compact_ensemble.py)
✅ Create ensemble submission script (create_ensemble_submission.py)
✅ Fix data loading implementation
✅ Test training script (1 epoch test passed)

PHASE 2: PARALLEL TRACK - UPLOAD v8
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    - Path A (< 0.90): Improve TCN
    - Path B (0.90-1.10): Continue with ensemble training ← EXPECTED
    - Path C (> 1.10): Use CompactCNN directly

PHASE 3: TRAINING (6-12 hours) 🎯 NEXT

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Training Metrics (per model)
- **Validation Pearson r**: Target > 0.15 (higher is better)
- **Validation NRMSE**: Target < 0.15 (lower is better)
- **Training stability**: Early stopping should trigger around epoch 20-30

### Ensemble Metrics
- **Ensemble vs Best Single**: Expect 5-10% improvement
- **Final Score**: Target 0.75-0.90 (vs current 1.01)
- **Improvement**: 15-25% better than quick_fix

### Competition Metrics
- **Upload**: < 100 MB (expected ~3-5 MB)
- **Format**: Pass all format checks
- **Score**: Beat 1.01 by 15-25%

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Training Fails:
1. Check data files exist in `data/cached/`
2. Verify torch installed: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"`
3. Check disk space for checkpoints
4. Monitor memory usage (24K samples × batch_size)

### If Score Worse Than 1.01:
1. Check validation metrics during training
2. Compare single models vs ensemble
3. May need more epochs (increase from 30)
4. May need different augmentation parameters

### If GPU Available:
Script auto-detects CUDA. No changes needed.
