## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### What Works (1.01 Score):
1. **CompactResponseTimeCNN** (75K params, C1: 1.0015)
   - 3 conv layers with progressive downsampling
   - Progressive dropout (0.3 → 0.4 → 0.5)
   - Simple CNN architecture

2. **EEGNeX from braindecode** (170K params, C2: 1.0087)
   - Standard proven architecture
   - No modifications needed

### What Failed (1.82 Score):
1. **ImprovedEEGModel** (168K params)
   - Too complex with attention mechanisms
   - One-size-fits-all approach

2. **SAM Optimizer**
   - Made performance 80% worse (1.01 → 1.82)
   - Experimental and undertrained

### Key Lessons:
- ✅ Simple beats complex (75K > 168K params)
- ✅ Task-specific models win
- ✅ Proven > Experimental
- ✅ Early stopping crucial
- ❌ SAM optimizer fails for this task
- ❌ Overparameterization hurts

## 🎯 Current Todo Checklist

```markdown
✅ [x] Stop training (kill 1847269)
⏳ [ ] Upload submission_tcn_v8.zip ← NEXT ACTION
⭕ [ ] Wait for v8 results (~10 min)
⭕ [ ] Record v8 score: _______
⭕ [ ] Choose path (A/B/C) based on score
⭕ [ ] Prepare v9 training
⭕ [ ] Submit v9
```

## 🔀 Decision Tree for v8 Results

### Path A: v8 < 0.90 (SUCCESS)
✅ **TCN works on test set!**
- Next: Create v9 with improved TCN + augmentation
- Expected: 0.60-0.80
- Training: 4-8 hours

### Path B: v8 = 0.90-1.10 (NEUTRAL)
🟡 **TCN similar to CompactCNN**
- Next: Create v9 with hybrid ensemble (CompactCNN + TCN)
- Expected: 0.80-0.95
- Training: 2-4 hours

### Path C: v8 > 1.10 (FAILED)
❌ **TCN doesn't transfer**
- Next: Abandon TCN, create v9 with CompactCNN replica
- Expected: 0.85-0.95 (5-15% better than 1.01)
- Training: 2-4 hours
