# EEG Challenge Status - October 25, 2025, 11:45 AM

## 🎯 Current Status: READY FOR SUBMISSION

### ✅ Critical Fix Completed
**ROOT CAUSE FOUND:** Previous submissions failed because they used `__call__(self, X, challenge_number)` instead of required `challenge_1(self, X)` and `challenge_2(self, X)` methods.

**SOLUTION:** Created `submission_sam_fixed_v2.zip` with correct API interface.

### 📦 Ready to Upload
**File:** `submission_sam_fixed_v2.zip` (467 KB)
- ✅ Correct methods: `challenge_1()` and `challenge_2()`
- ✅ All local tests pass
- ✅ Returns proper np.ndarray(float32) shapes
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Graceful error handling

**Expected Performance:**
- Challenge 1: NRMSE ~0.30 (at target threshold)
- Challenge 2: NRMSE ~0.20 (competitive)
- Combined: 0.25-0.45 (good ranking)

### 📝 Documentation Updated
- ✅ Memory bank updated with submission requirements
- ✅ SUBMISSION_FIX_V2_OCT25.md created
- ✅ Local test results documented

### ⛔ Enhanced Training Status
**Status:** Blocked by GPU memory issues

**Problem:** AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT + ROCm SDK 6.1.2 cannot handle:
- EnhancedEEGNeX (254K params) - 4x larger than baseline
- HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_APERTURE_VIOLATION errors
- Occurs during GPU initialization, not training

**Attempted Fixes:**
- ✅ Disabled all augmentation (temporal_masking, magnitude_warping, mixup)
- ✅ Set batch_size=4, num_workers=0, pin_memory=False
- ✅ Reduced subjects to 20 per dataset
- ✅ Disabled LR scheduler
- ❌ Still crashes during GPU initialization

**Recommendation:** Use baseline SAM submission (already excellent performance)

### 🔄 Next Actions

**IMMEDIATE (Next 10 minutes):**
1. Upload `submission_sam_fixed_v2.zip` to Codabench
2. Monitor evaluation progress

**SHORT TERM (Next 1-2 hours):**
3. Check leaderboard ranking
4. If successful: Consider submitting to multiple challenges
5. If fails: Review Codabench logs (very unlikely now)

**OPTIONAL (If time permits):**
6. Try simplified enhanced model (TemporalAttention only, ~150K params)
7. Or focus on ensemble methods with baseline models

### 📊 Todo List

```markdown
## Submission
- [x] Fix submission interface (challenge_1/challenge_2 methods)
- [x] Test locally
- [x] Create v2 zip
- [x] Update memory bank
- [ ] Upload to Codabench ⬅️ NEXT STEP
- [ ] Monitor evaluation
- [ ] Check leaderboard

## Enhanced Training (Optional)
- [ ] Decide: Try simplified model OR stick with baseline
- [ ] If simplified: Remove MultiScaleFeatures, keep TemporalAttention
- [ ] If baseline: Focus on other optimizations

## Documentation
- [x] SUBMISSION_FIX_V2_OCT25.md
- [x] STATUS_OCT25_1145AM.md
- [x] Memory bank updated
