## Next Steps

### Immediate (Tonight)
1. ⏰ Monitor training progress
   ```bash
   tail -f training_full.log
   watch -n 2 rocm-smi
   ```

2. ⏰ Wait for completion (2-4 hours)
   - Early stopping may trigger around epoch 40-60
   - Best model saved automatically

3. ⏰ Analyze results
   ```bash
   python -c "
   import json
   with open('experiments/sam_full_run/*/history.json') as f:
       history = json.load(f)
   print(f'Best Val NRMSE: {min(history[\"val_nrmse\"]):.4f}')
   "
   ```

4. ⏰ Create submission if successful (NRMSE < 1.0)
   ```bash
   cp experiments/sam_full_run/*/checkpoints/best_model.pt weights_challenge_1_sam.pt
   # Update submission.py
   # Create submission_sam.zip
   # Upload to Codabench
   ```

## Risks & Mitigation

### Active Risks
1. **Training time longer than expected**
   - Mitigation: Running overnight, early stopping enabled
   
2. **NRMSE may not improve enough**
   - Mitigation: Have ensemble methods ready, can try focal loss
   
3. **GPU memory issues**
   - Mitigation: Tested with batch_size=16, can reduce if needed

### Mitigated Risks ✅
- ~~Data loading issues~~ - Working perfectly
- ~~SAM integration bugs~~ - Tested successfully
- ~~Subject leakage~~ - GroupKFold verified
- ~~Code crashes~~ - Checkpointing implemented

## Key Learnings

### What Worked Well ✅
1. **Hybrid approach:** Combining proven data loader with new features
2. **Incremental testing:** 2-epoch test before full training
3. **Crash recovery:** All work preserved from VSCode crash
4. **Clear documentation:** Phase reports helped maintain focus

### What to Improve
1. **Data exploration earlier:** Should have checked event format sooner
2. **JSON serialization:** Caught late (now fixed)
3. **Time estimation:** Tasks took longer than planned

### Best Practices Established
1. Always test with small subset first
2. Document investigation findings
3. Keep proven code as fallback
4. Use subject-level CV for realistic validation
