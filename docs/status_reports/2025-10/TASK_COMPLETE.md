- [x] Combined class handles both C1 and C2

- [x] Loads respective SAM weights
- [x] Implements required interface (get_model_challenge_1, get_model_challenge_2, __call__)

### ✅ Task 2: Rename C2 Weights
- [x] Renamed `weights_challenge_2_correct.pt` → `weights_challenge_2_sam.pt`
- [x] Verified size: 257K
- [x] Matches C1 naming convention (`weights_challenge_1_sam.pt`)

### ✅ Task 3: Package Submission

  - weights_challenge_2_sam.pt (257K)
- [x] Verified package structure with `unzip -l`
- [x] Confirmed size under 1MB limit

### ⚠️ Task 4: Test Locally (Partially Complete)
- [x] Created test script: `test_sam_submission.py`
