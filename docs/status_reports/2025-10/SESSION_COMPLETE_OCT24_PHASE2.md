## Lessons Learned

### 1. nohup is Insufficient
- **Problem:** Background processes still die with parent (VSCode)
- **Evidence:** Lost 2 training attempts to VSCode crashes
- **Solution:** Tmux provides true process isolation

### 2. Tmux is Industry Standard
- **Benefit:** Survives crashes, disconnects, terminal closes
- **Features:** Attach/detach anytime, multiple panes, session management
- **Use Case:** Any training longer than 30 minutes

### 3. Test Before Full Training
- **Approach:** 2-epoch test with small subset (6 subjects)
- **Time Saved:** Found issues in 5 minutes vs 3 hours
- **Validation:** Data loading, SAM optimizer, checkpointing all working

### 4. Document Everything
- **Reason:** Critical for crash recovery
- **Practice:** Status docs after every major step
- **Benefit:** Quick recovery, clear progress tracking

### 5. Data Loading Takes Time
- **Reality:** 334 subjects = 5-10 minutes to load
- **Impact:** Training doesn't start immediately
- **Monitor:** Use monitor script to check progress

---

## Current Status

### Tmux Training Session
- **Session Name:** `eeg_training`
- **Status:** ✅ ACTIVE - Data loading in progress
- **Start Time:** 17:00 UTC (October 24, 2025)
- **Current Activity:** Loading 334 subjects (150 + 184)
- **Expected:** 5-10 min data load, 2-4 hours training

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Quick status check
./monitor_training.sh

# Watch live output
tail -f training_tmux.log

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)
1. Check if data loading complete: `./monitor_training.sh`
2. Verify first epoch started
3. Confirm GPU utilization (~3-4 GB VRAM)

### Short Term (1-3 hours)
1. Monitor epoch progress (~5-10 epochs per hour)
2. Watch NRMSE improvement
3. Verify no errors or crashes

### Medium Term (Tonight/Tomorrow)
1. Training should complete (early stopping likely)
2. Analyze final results
3. Create submission if Val NRMSE < 1.0
4. Upload to Codabench

## Risk Assessment

### Resolved Risks
- ✅ VSCode crashes → Solved with tmux
- ✅ Training not starting → Solved with working data loader
- ✅ SAM optimizer issues → Tested successfully
- ✅ Data leakage → Solved with subject-level CV

### Remaining Risks
- ⚠️ NRMSE not improving → Mitigate with hyperparameter tuning
- ⚠️ GPU memory issues → Already optimized (batch_size=32)
- ⚠️ Time constraints → 9 days remaining, on track

### Contingency Plans
- **If NRMSE > 1.0:** Try different hyperparameters (lower rho, LR)
- **If training fails:** Use ensemble with Oct 16 weights (1.002 C1)
- **If time tight:** Submit working solution, iterate later

---

## Competition Context

### Deadline
- **Date:** November 3, 2025
- **Days Remaining:** 9 days
- **Time Pressure:** Moderate (adequate time for 2-3 more iterations)

### Current Best Scores
- **Challenge 1:** 1.002 (Oct 16 submission)
- **Challenge 2:** 1.460 (Oct 16 submission)
- **Overall:** 1.322 (Oct 16 submission)

### This Attempt
- **Innovation:** SAM + Subject-CV + Augmentation
- **Expected Improvement:** Significant (test showed 12.9% in 1 epoch)
- **Target:** Challenge 1 NRMSE < 0.8 (20% improvement over Oct 16)

## Key Insights

### What Worked
1. **Incremental approach** - Phase 1 → Test → Phase 2
2. **Early testing** - 2 epochs saved hours of debugging
3. **Tmux solution** - Professional, crash-resistant
4. **Documentation** - Status docs enabled quick recovery
5. **Subject-level CV** - Prevents data leakage

### What Didn't Work
1. **nohup for long training** - Insufficient isolation
2. **Assuming VSCode stability** - Need process independence
3. **Starting full training without test** - Would waste time

### Future Improvements
1. **Always use tmux** - For any training > 30 minutes
2. **Test everything** - Small runs before big ones
3. **Monitor proactively** - Check progress every 30-60 minutes
4. **Document continuously** - Status after each major step

## Technical Notes

### SAM Optimizer Details
- **Purpose:** Find flatter minima for better generalization
- **Method:** Ascent step + descent step per iteration
- **Hyperparameter:** rho = 0.05 (perturbation radius)
- **Benefit:** Improved cross-subject generalization
- **Cost:** 2x forward passes (slower but worth it)

### Subject-Level CV Details
- **Method:** GroupKFold with subjects as groups
- **Benefit:** No data leakage (same subject not in train & val)
- **Split:** 80/20 train/val at subject level
- **Test Run:** 5 train subjects, 1 val subject

### Augmentation Details
- **Scaling:** Random amplitude scaling (0.8-1.2)
- **Channel Dropout:** Random channels zeroed (p=0.1)
- **Noise:** Gaussian noise added (scale=0.01)
- **Purpose:** Improve robustness to variability
