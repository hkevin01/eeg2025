## 🔑 Key Insights

### About TTA:
- ❌ **NOT** a training method
- ✅ **IS** an inference-time technique
- Works by averaging predictions over augmented inputs
- No retraining required - instant improvement
- Can be applied to ANY model

### About Current Implementation:
- v5 uses TTA with EXISTING trained models
- Expected 5-10% improvement without any retraining
- To improve further, need to train NEW models (TCN, S4, etc.)
- Those new models will ALSO benefit from TTA on top

### About Training Time:
- TCN: 4-8 hours
- S4: 8-16 hours
- Multi-task: 6-12 hours
- Ensemble (5 variants): 10 hours
- Total: ~30-50 hours for all improvements

## 🎓 What You Learned

1. **TTA is inference-time, not training-time**
   - Can be applied immediately without retraining
   - Works by averaging predictions over augmented inputs
   - Expected 5-10% improvement

2. **Module Architecture**
   - All algorithms implemented in single cohesive module
   - Modular design allows flexible combination
   - Each algorithm independently testable

3. **Competition Strategy**
   - Start with quick wins (TTA) → Immediate improvement
   - Train advanced models while waiting for results
   - Layer improvements for cumulative gains
   - Expected total: 40-50% improvement → #1 ranking

## 🏆 Success Metrics

### Minimum Goal (Must Achieve):
- [x] All algorithms implemented ✅
- [ ] v5 uploaded and evaluated
- [ ] No degradation vs v4
- [ ] Reach Top 20

### Target Goal (Should Achieve):
- [ ] v6 with TCN reaches Top 10
- [ ] v7 with ensemble reaches Top 3
- [ ] Final < 0.20 NRMSE

### Stretch Goal (Could Achieve):
- [ ] v8 with super-ensemble reaches #1
- [ ] Final < 0.17 NRMSE
- [ ] >0.05 NRMSE lead over #2

## 🚨 Critical Reminders

1. **Upload v5 NOW** - It's ready and will give instant improvement
2. **Start TCN training TODAY** - Takes 4-8 hours
3. **Monitor Codabench** - v5 results in 1-2 hours
4. **Don't wait** - Train models in parallel while v5 evaluates
5. **Document everything** - Track results for analysis
