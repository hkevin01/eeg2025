## 🚨 Risk Management

### High Priority Risks:
1. **TTA might not generalize to test set**
   - Mitigation: Conservative augmentation strength (0.08)
   - Backup: Have v4 baseline if TTA degrades performance
   
2. **Overfitting with ensemble**
   - Mitigation: Use diverse model variants
   - Validation: Cross-validation on multiple splits

3. **Time constraint (16 days)**
   - Mitigation: Prioritize quick wins (TTA, Ensemble)
   - Fallback: Skip advanced models if time limited

### Medium Priority Risks:
1. **Codabench processing delays**
   - Mitigation: Submit early in the day
   - Plan: Multiple submissions per week

2. **Model complexity vs runtime**
   - Mitigation: Test inference time locally
   - Limit: Keep inference < 5 seconds per sample
