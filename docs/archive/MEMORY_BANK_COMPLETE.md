## 🚀 How to Use

### Scenario 1: Lost Chat Context (Most Common)
```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
cat memory-bank/QUICKSTART.md
./check_c2_training.sh
```
**Time to resume:** < 5 minutes

### Scenario 2: New Chat Session
```bash
# Tell new AI assistant:
"Read memory-bank/QUICKSTART.md, then memory-bank/app-description.md, 
then continue from memory-bank/implementation-plans/submission-v6.md"
```
**Time to full context:** < 10 minutes

### Scenario 3: Long Break (Days/Weeks)
```bash
# Read in order:
1. memory-bank/QUICKSTART.md         # Current state
2. memory-bank/change-log.md         # What happened
3. memory-bank/implementation-plans/ # What's next
```
**Time to resume:** < 15 minutes

### Scenario 4: Explaining to Someone Else
```bash
# Share these files:
memory-bank/README.md          # Overview
memory-bank/app-description.md # Full context
```

## 💡 Key Insights Captured

### What Works
1. **TCN:** 65% improvement on Challenge 1
2. **tmux:** Training survives all crashes
3. **Documentation:** Enables instant recovery
4. **ACID planning:** Clear, trackable progress

### Critical Bugs Fixed
1. **Window indexing:** array[0] not array
2. **dtype mismatch:** Float32 vs Float64
3. **Monitor confusion:** Wrong log file
4. **Architecture mismatch:** Missing BatchNorm

### Current Challenges
1. **Challenge 2:** Early training, improving slowly
2. **Time pressure:** Competition deadline approaching
3. **Validation:** Need < 0.30 NRMSE (currently 0.817)

## 🎓 How to Tell AI About This

When starting a new chat, simply say:

```
"I have a memory bank for this project. Please read:
1. memory-bank/QUICKSTART.md - for current status
2. memory-bank/app-description.md - for full context
3. memory-bank/implementation-plans/submission-v6.md - for next tasks

Then continue where we left off."
```

The AI will have complete context in minutes!

## 📈 Impact

### Before Memory Bank
- Lost context = lost hours rebuilding understanding
- Crashes = panic, confusion
- Breaks = forgot what we were doing
- Decisions = why did we do that?

### After Memory Bank
- Lost context = 5 min to full speed
- Crashes = no problem, docs + tmux safe
- Breaks = quick refresh, continue
- Decisions = fully documented rationale

**Time Saved:** Hours per interruption  
**Stress Reduced:** Significantly  
**Quality Increased:** Clear documentation

---

## 🎉 Summary

**You now have a complete memory bank** that enables instant project recovery from any interruption. Whether you lose chat context, VS Code crashes, or take a long break, you can resume in < 5 minutes.

**Start here next time:** `memory-bank/QUICKSTART.md`

**Training continues independently** in tmux (session: eeg_both_challenges)

**Next milestone:** Challenge 2 training completion (~30-60 min)

**Everything is documented. Nothing is lost. Continue with confidence!** 🚀
