  ```
  data/raw/ds005505-bdf/sub-NDARDL511UND/eeg/
  sub-NDARDL511UND_task-contrastChangeDetection_run-3_eeg.bdf
  ```
- **Error:** `IndexError: list index out of range`
- **Needs:** Restart after fixing

## üìä Timeline Update

| Task | Original Estimate | Current Status |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| Data Download | ~1 hour | üîÑ Still in progress (10+ min so far) |
| Challenge 1 Training | ~8 hours | ‚è≥ Waiting for download |
| Challenge 2 Training | ~6 hours | ‚ùå Failed, needs restart |

## üîß Required Actions

### Immediate: Fix Challenge 2

**Step 1: Remove corrupted file**
```bash
rm data/raw/ds005505-bdf/sub-NDARDL511UND/eeg/sub-NDARDL511UND_task-contrastChangeDetection_run-3_eeg.bdf
```

**Step 2: Restart Challenge 2**
```bash
nohup python3 scripts/train_challenge2_multi_release.py > logs/challenge2_training_retry.log 2>&1 &
```

**Step 3: Monitor both processes**
```bash
ps aux | grep train_challenge | grep -v grep
tail -f logs/challenge1_training.log
tail -f logs/challenge2_training_retry.log
```

### Alternative: Wait Approach

1. Let Challenge 1 finish downloading first
2. Observe if it completes successfully
3. Then fix and restart Challenge 2
4. This is safer but takes longer

## ‚è∞ Revised Timeline

If we fix Challenge 2 now:
- **+30 min:** Data download completes for both
- **+8 hours:** Training progresses
- **+14 hours:** Both complete (tomorrow ~10 PM)

If we wait to fix Challenge 2:
- **+2 hours:** Challenge 1 download + preprocessing
- **+10 hours:** Challenge 1 training completes
- **Then:** Fix and start Challenge 2 (~8 hours more)
- **Total:** ~20 hours (tomorrow afternoon)

## üéØ Recommendation

**FIX CHALLENGE 2 NOW** to keep both running in parallel:
1. Remove corrupted file
2. Restart Challenge 2
3. Monitor both logs for any other issues
4. Let them run overnight

This way both will complete around the same time tomorrow.
