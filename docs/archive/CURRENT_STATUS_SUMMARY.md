# Current Status Summary - EEG Challenge Training

**Time:** October 16, 2025 13:52  
**Status:** ‚úÖ BOTH TRAININGS ACTIVE AND PROGRESSING

---

## üéØ Quick Status

### Challenge 1: Response Time Prediction
- **Status:** üîÑ Epoch 1/50 (data loading/preprocessing)
- **Model:** CompactResponseTimeCNN (200K params)
- **Data:** R1-R4 train, R5 validation
- **Fix Applied:** Using `rt_from_stimulus` from metadata ‚úÖ
- **Log:** `logs/challenge1_training_v5.log`

### Challenge 2: Externalizing Factor Prediction
- **Status:** üîÑ Epoch 3/50 (TRAINING ACTIVELY)
- **Model:** CompactExternalizingCNN (64K params)
- **Data:** R1-R4 (331K windows), R5 validation
- **Training NRMSE:** 0.8494 (decreasing! ‚úÖ)
- **Validation NRMSE:** 20M+ (high, but expected to stabilize)
- **Log:** `logs/challenge2_training_v6.log`

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Challenge 2 is learning!**
   - Train NRMSE: 0.9244 ‚Üí 0.8494 (improving)
   - Model is NOT predicting constant (would be 0.0)
   - Externalizing scores are diverse: Range [-0.387, 0.620]

2. **All bugs fixed:**
   - ‚úÖ Metadata extraction (list vs dict)
   - ‚úÖ Target field names (rt_from_stimulus, externalizing)
   - ‚úÖ Multi-release training (R1-R4)
   - ‚úÖ Model architectures match submission.py

3. **Challenge 1 loading properly:**
   - Processing R1-R5 releases
   - Creating windows with correct metadata

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What to Watch

1. **Challenge 2 Validation NRMSE (20M+)**
   - Very high, but training NRMSE is good
   - Possible causes:
     - Validation set (R5) might have different distribution
     - Early epochs often unstable
     - Should stabilize after 5-10 epochs
   - **Action:** Monitor for next few epochs
   - **If stays high:** May need to adjust approach

2. **Challenge 1 First Epoch**
   - Still loading data (slow preprocessing)
   - Need to verify NRMSE > 0.0 when it completes
   - **Expected:** 30-60 more minutes for Epoch 1

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

```
‚úÖ COMPLETED:
- [x] Fixed all 6 critical bugs
- [x] Started both trainings with correct configurations
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation
- [x] Created TODO list
- [x] Verified Challenge 2 has diverse targets
- [x] Verified Challenge 2 is learning (Train NRMSE decreasing)

üîÑ IN PROGRESS:
- [ ] Challenge 1 Epoch 1 (loading data)
- [ ] Challenge 2 Epoch 3 ‚Üí 50 (training)

‚è≥ WAITING:
- [ ] Challenge 1 first epoch completion (~30-60 min)
- [ ] Verify Challenge 1 NRMSE > 0.0
- [ ] Challenge 2 validation stabilization (5-10 epochs)
- [ ] Both trainings complete (~2-3 hours)

üì¶ AFTER TRAINING:
- [ ] Test submission.py
- [ ] Convert METHODS_DOCUMENT.md to PDF
- [ ] Create submission.zip
- [ ] Upload to Codabench
```

## üîç Monitoring Commands

**Check Challenge 1:**
```bash
tail -100 logs/challenge1_training_v5.log | grep -E "Epoch|NRMSE"
```

**Check Challenge 2:**
```bash
tail -100 logs/challenge2_training_v6.log | grep -E "Epoch|NRMSE"
```

**Check both at once:**
```bash
echo "=== CHALLENGE 1 ===" && \
tail -50 logs/challenge1_training_v5.log | grep -E "Epoch|NRMSE" | tail -5 && \
echo -e "\n=== CHALLENGE 2 ===" && \
tail -50 logs/challenge2_training_v6.log | grep -E "Epoch|NRMSE" | tail -5
```

**Monitor live:**
```bash
watch -n 30 "tail -50 logs/challenge1_training_v5.log | grep -E 'Epoch|NRMSE' | tail -5 && \
echo '---' && \
tail -50 logs/challenge2_training_v6.log | grep -E 'Epoch|NRMSE' | tail -5"
```

## üìä Expected Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| **13:35** | Challenge 1 v5 started (loading R1-R5) |
| **13:52** | Current time - C1 on Epoch 1, C2 on Epoch 3 |
| **14:30** | Challenge 1 Epoch 1 complete (estimated) |
| **15:30** | Challenge 2 complete (estimated) |
| **16:00** | Challenge 1 complete (estimated) |
| **16:30** | Submission ready (estimated) |

## üéØ Success Criteria

**Minimum (Must Have):**
- ‚úÖ Train NRMSE > 0.0 (not constant) - **Challenge 2 PASSING**
- ‚è≥ Val NRMSE > 0.0 (not constant) - **Challenge 2 TBD**
- ‚è≥ Challenge 1 NRMSE > 0.0 - **Waiting for Epoch 1**

**Competitive (Target):**
- Challenge 1 NRMSE < 1.5
- Challenge 2 NRMSE < 0.6
- Overall < 0.8

**Stretch (Top 3):**
- Overall < 0.5

## üö® If Things Go Wrong

**If Challenge 1 NRMSE = 0.0:**
- Check if `rt_from_stimulus` is in metadata
- Print first 10 targets to verify diversity
- May need to debug metadata extraction again

**If Challenge 2 Val NRMSE stays > 1000:**
- Validation set may have different scale
- Try different normalization
- May need subject-level normalization instead of window-level

**If training crashes:**
- Check `logs/challenge*_crash_*.log`
- Reduce batch size or num_workers
- Check memory with `htop`
