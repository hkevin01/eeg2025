# Next Session TODO

**Date**: Tomorrow (October 15, 2025)  
**Focus**: Check training results & start Challenge implementation

---

## ‚úÖ Before You Start

```bash
# 1. Check if training completed
bash scripts/monitor_training.sh

# 2. View training log
tail -100 logs/training_*.log

# 3. Check for checkpoints
ls -lh checkpoints/

# 4. If training still running, let it continue
ps aux | grep train_foundation_cpu
```

## üìã TODO List

### Priority 1: Verify Training ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- [ ] Check if training completed successfully
- [ ] Review training metrics (loss, accuracy)
- [ ] Verify best model checkpoint exists
- [ ] Test model loading and inference

### Priority 2: Challenge 1 Implementation ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- [ ] Load pretrained foundation model
- [ ] Create transfer learning head for CCD task
- [ ] Fine-tune on CCD dataset
- [ ] Evaluate: Target Pearson r > 0.3, AUROC > 0.7
- [ ] Save Challenge 1 submission

### Priority 3: Challenge 2 Implementation ‚≠ê‚≠ê
- [ ] Load pretrained foundation model  
- [ ] Create 4-output regression head (P-factors)
- [ ] Train on psychopathology data
- [ ] Evaluate: Target Average Pearson r > 0.2
- [ ] Save Challenge 2 submission

### Priority 4: Optimization ‚≠ê
- [ ] Profile inference latency
- [ ] Implement quantization if needed
- [ ] Target: <50ms inference (current baseline: 186ms)

### Optional: More Data
- [ ] Download 20-30 more HBN subjects if needed
- [ ] Retrain with larger dataset if time permits

## üìÅ Key Files to Use

### Models
- `checkpoints/best_model.pth` - Trained foundation model
- `scripts/models/eeg_dataset_production.py` - Data loader

### Templates (to create)
- `scripts/challenge1_transfer.py` - Challenge 1 implementation
- `scripts/challenge2_regression.py` - Challenge 2 implementation

### Reference
- `docs/competition_implementation_plan.md` - Challenge specifications
- `logs/training_*.log` - Training results
- `SESSION_SUMMARY_20251014.md` - Today's accomplishments

## üéØ Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Training completed with reasonable loss/accuracy
- ‚úÖ Challenge 1 implemented and evaluated
- ‚úÖ Challenge 2 implemented and evaluated
- ‚úÖ Both challenges meet minimum thresholds
- ‚úÖ Ready for final optimization and submission

---

## üí° Tips

1. **Use the trained model**: Don't retrain from scratch
2. **Start simple**: Basic transfer learning first
3. **Test quickly**: Validate approach before full training
4. **Check data**: Ensure Challenge datasets load correctly
5. **Save checkpoints**: Don't lose work

---

## üö® If Training Failed

If training crashed or didn't complete:
1. Check logs for errors
2. Reduce batch size or model size
3. Restart training with adjusted config
4. Consider using synthetic data for testing

---

## üìû Quick Commands

```bash
# Monitor training
bash scripts/monitor_training.sh

# Load and test model
python3 -c "
import torch
checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoints/best_model.pth')
print('Epoch:', checkpoint['epoch'])
print('Train loss:', checkpoint['train_loss'])
print('Val loss:', checkpoint['val_loss'])
"

# Check data
python3 scripts/models/eeg_dataset_production.py

# Start Challenge 1
# (create this file tomorrow)
python3 scripts/challenge1_transfer.py
```

---

## üéØ End Goal

By end of tomorrow:
- ‚úÖ Foundation model verified working
- ‚úÖ Challenge 1 implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ Challenge 2 implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ Ready for optimization phase

**Let's keep the momentum going!** üöÄ
