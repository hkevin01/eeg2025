## 🔍 What Happens During Evaluation

### Codabench Process:
1. **Unzip:** Extracts your submission files
2. **Import:** Loads your Submission class
3. **Challenge 1:**
   - Calls `get_model_challenge_1()`
   - Loads `weights_challenge_1.pt`
   - Runs inference on test set
   - Calculates NRMSE
4. **Challenge 2:**
   - Calls `get_model_challenge_2()`
   - Loads `weights_challenge_2.pt`
   - Runs inference on test set
   - Calculates NRMSE
5. **Score:** Computes overall = 0.3 × C1 + 0.7 × C2
6. **Leaderboard:** Posts your scores publicly

### Verification:
- ✅ Organizers validate results
- ✅ Code must run successfully
- ✅ Models must fit in 20GB GPU memory
- ✅ Scores must be reasonable
