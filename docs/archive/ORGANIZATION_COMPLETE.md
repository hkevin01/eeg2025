# Project Organization Complete ✅

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Task:** Root folder cleanup + comprehensive documentation

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Root Folder Organization
**Before:** 40+ files cluttering root directory  
**After:** Clean, organized structure with competition-essential files only

#### Files Kept in Root (Competition Required)
- ✅ `submission.py` - Entry point
- ✅ `weights_challenge_1.pt` - Model weights (3.2 MB)
- ✅ `weights_challenge_2.pt` - Model weights (971 KB)
- ✅ `submission_complete.zip` - Submission package (1.7 MB)
- ✅ `README.md` - Project overview
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- ✅ Configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.py, Makefile)

#### Files Moved to Subfolders
**`docs/planning/` (9 files)**
- All TODO lists (TODO_MASTER.md, TODO_PART*.md, etc.)

**`docs/status/` (9 files)**
- Competition status files
- Submission checklists
- Changelog and next steps

**`docs/guides/` (5 files)**
- Quick start guides
- Challenge plans
- PDF conversion instructions

**`docs/methods/` (3 files)**
- Methods document (Markdown, HTML, TeX)

**`docs/summaries/` (3 files)**
- Session summaries
- Validation summaries

**`archive/` (2 files)**
- Old weights and submission packages

---

### 2. New Documentation Created

#### A. Documentation Index
**File:** `docs/INDEX.md`
- Complete navigation guide
- Organized by purpose (submission, performance, status)
- Quick links to important files

#### B. Validation Summary (3 Parts + Master)
**Files:**
- `docs/VALIDATION_SUMMARY_PART1_CROSSVAL.md` - Cross-validation results
- `docs/VALIDATION_SUMMARY_PART2_ENSEMBLE.md` - Ensemble training
- `docs/VALIDATION_SUMMARY_PART3_FINAL.md` - Comparison & recommendations
- `docs/VALIDATION_SUMMARY_MASTER.md` - Complete overview

**Summary:** All validation experiments documented, showing production model is optimal.

## 📊 Validation Experiments Completed

### Cross-Validation (5 folds)
- ✅ Baseline model: NRMSE 1.0530
- ✅ Confirmed need for improvements
- ✅ Results: `results/challenge1_crossval.txt`

### Ensemble Training (3 seeds)
- ✅ Multiple seeds: NRMSE 1.0703
- ✅ Stable training confirmed
- ✅ Results: `results/challenge1_ensemble.txt`

### Production Model Validation
- ✅ Challenge 1: NRMSE 0.4680 (2.2x better than baseline)
- ✅ Challenge 2: NRMSE 0.0808 (excellent)
- ✅ Overall: NRMSE 0.1970 (2.5x better than target)
