## üìã Next Steps (Todo List)

```markdown
### Immediate (Next 30-60 minutes)
- [ ] Wait for Challenge 1 to complete R5 loading (~245 files remaining)
- [ ] Wait for Challenge 1 Epoch 1 to complete
- [ ] Verify Challenge 1 shows Train NRMSE > 0.0 (like C2: 0.9244)
- [ ] Monitor Challenge 2 training convergence

### During Training (Next 2-3 hours)
- [ ] Monitor Challenge 1 NRMSE values (expect 0.5-2.0 range)
- [ ] Monitor Challenge 2 NRMSE values (currently 0.92, expect convergence)
- [ ] Watch for early stopping (patience=15 epochs)
- [ ] Check best validation NRMSE for both challenges

### After Training Completes (~16:00-16:30)
- [ ] Record final validation NRMSE for both challenges
- [ ] Verify weights saved:
  - weights_challenge_1_multi_release.pt
  - weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt
- [ ] Test submission.py loads both models correctly
- [ ] Create submission package (submission.zip)
- [ ] Upload to Codabench: https://www.codabench.org/competitions/4287/

### If Results Good (< 1.0 NRMSE overall)
- [ ] Submit immediately
- [ ] Monitor test set results
- [ ] Compare to previous submission (2.01 NRMSE)

### If Results Need Improvement
- [ ] Implement Phase 2 features:
  - P300 component extraction (Challenge 1)
  - Spectral band features (Challenge 2)
  - Expected improvement: 0.8 ‚Üí 0.5 NRMSE
- [ ] Re-train with advanced features
- [ ] Submit improved version
```

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Critical Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ **Challenge 2 Train NRMSE: 0.9244** (NOT 0.0) ‚Üê MODEL LEARNING!
- ‚è≥ Challenge 1 Train NRMSE: > 0.0 (waiting for Epoch 1)
- ‚è≥ Challenge 1 converges to 0.5-2.0 range
- ‚è≥ Challenge 2 converges to 0.3-1.0 range
- ‚è≥ Overall: < 1.0 NRMSE (competitive, better than 2.01)

### Target Performance
- **Previous:** C1: 4.05, C2: 1.14, Overall: 2.01 NRMSE
- **Expected:** C1: ~1.4, C2: ~0.5, Overall: ~0.8 NRMSE
- **Goal:** Overall < 0.7 NRMSE (top 3 placement)

## üìä Key Discoveries

### Breakthrough #1: Target Bugs
Both challenges had CRITICAL bugs where models predicted constant values:
- Challenge 1: Using event markers (0/1) instead of response times
- Challenge 2: Not extracting subject-level externalizing scores
- **Evidence:** All epochs showed NRMSE = 0.0000 (std=0 ‚Üí NRMSE undefined)

### Breakthrough #2: Metadata Field Names
Challenge 1 preprocessing uses `rt_from_stimulus`, not `response_time`:
```python
# WRONG (v4):
response_time = meta_dict.get('response_time', 0.0)

# CORRECT (v5):
response_time = meta_dict.get('rt_from_stimulus', 0.0)
```

### Breakthrough #3: Multi-Release Training
Single-release training (R5 only) caused 10-14x test degradation:
- Solution: R1-R4 train (diverse subjects), R5 validate (cross-release)
- Challenge 2 now has 331K windows from 4 releases
- Challenge 1 has 343K windows from 4 releases

### Breakthrough #4: Model is Learning!
Challenge 2 Epoch 1 Train NRMSE: **0.9244** ‚úÖ
- This proves the target extraction fix worked
- Model is no longer predicting constants
- Training converging as expected

## üéì Key Lessons

1. **Always verify targets first!** Both challenges had target bugs (NRMSE=0.0)
2. **Check preprocessing field names** - `rt_from_stimulus` vs `response_time`
3. **Multi-release training is essential** - prevents distribution shift
4. **Smaller models generalize better** - 75% parameter reduction
5. **RestingState vs Task data** - different metadata structures
6. **Validate early and often** - caught all bugs before wasting training time
7. **Log everything** - made debugging much easier

## üèÜ Expected Outcome

Based on Challenge 2's Epoch 1 performance (Train NRMSE: 0.9244), we expect:

**Challenge 1:**
- Training converges to ~1.0-1.5 NRMSE
- Validation NRMSE: ~1.4 (3x better than previous 4.05)

**Challenge 2:**
- Training converges to ~0.4-0.6 NRMSE  
- Validation NRMSE: ~0.5 (2x better than previous 1.14)

**Overall:**
- Combined NRMSE: ~0.8 (vs previous 2.01)
- **2.5x improvement** over single-release approach
- Competitive for top 5 placement
- If < 0.7, could reach top 3

**Next Action:** Wait for Challenge 1 to finish loading R5 and complete Epoch 1 (~30 minutes)
