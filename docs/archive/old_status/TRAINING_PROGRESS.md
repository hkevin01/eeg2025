## 🎯 Next Actions (After Training)

### Immediate (When Training Completes)
1. **Check final metrics**
   ```bash
   tail -100 logs/foundation_final_*.log
   ```

2. **Load best checkpoint**
   ```bash
   ls -lth checkpoints/foundation_best.pth
   ```

3. **Test model inference**
   ```python
   import torch
   checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoints/foundation_best.pth')
   print(checkpoint.keys())
   ```

### Challenge 1 Implementation
1. **Create transfer learning script**
   - Load foundation model
   - Freeze encoder (or partial fine-tuning)
   - Add regression head for age
   - Train on age labels

2. **Training configuration**
   ```python
   {
       'learning_rate': 5e-5,  # Lower for fine-tuning
       'epochs': 10,
       'freeze_encoder': True,  # or False for full fine-tuning
       'batch_size': 32,
   }
   ```

3. **Evaluation metrics**
   - Pearson correlation (r > 0.3 target)
   - AUROC (> 0.7 target)
   - MAE, RMSE for regression

### Challenge 2 Implementation
Similar to Challenge 1 but:
- Binary classification head
- Cross-entropy loss
- Accuracy, precision, recall metrics

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Training Stops
```bash
# Check if process died
ps aux | grep python

# Check last log entries
tail -50 logs/foundation_final_*.log

# Check for errors
grep -i error logs/foundation_final_*.log

# Restart training
python3 scripts/train_foundation_final.py > logs/foundation_restart_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &
```

### If System Slows Down
```bash
# Check memory usage
free -h

# Check if swap is being used
swapon --show

# Reduce batch size in script if needed
```

## 📈 Success Criteria

### Foundation Model
- ✅ Training runs without crashes
- ✅ Loss decreases over epochs
- ✅ Validation accuracy > random (50%)
- ✅ Best checkpoint saved
- ✅ Model can be loaded for inference

### Challenge 1 (Age Prediction)
- ⭕ Pearson r > 0.3 on validation set
- ⭕ AUROC > 0.7
- ⭕ Submission file generated
- ⭕ Predictions look reasonable

### Challenge 2 (Sex Classification)
- ⭕ Accuracy > 50% (better than random)
- ⭕ Good precision/recall balance
- ⭕ Submission file generated

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Works
1. **CPU training is stable** - No crashes, reliable
2. **Dataset loader verified** - 38,506 windows loaded correctly
3. **Safety system works** - GPU issues avoided
4. **OpenNLP-GPU pattern** - CPU for production is smart

### What Doesn't Work
1. **GPU training crashes** - RX 5700 XT incompatible with ROCm 6.2
2. **Large models on GPU** - Causes system blackouts
3. **Background processes without logging** - Hard to debug

### Best Practices
1. **Always log to file** - `> logs/output.log 2>&1`
2. **Monitor CPU/memory** - Use `top`, `htop`
3. **Save checkpoints frequently** - Every 2 epochs
4. **Test on small data first** - Verify before full training
5. **CPU is OK for prototyping** - GPU not always necessary
