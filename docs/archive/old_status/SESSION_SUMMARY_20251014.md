# Session Summary - October 14, 2025

## 🎯 Mission Status: SUCCESS ✅

**Primary Goal**: Start P2 foundation model training  
**Result**: Training is now running on CPU in background!

---

## 📊 Session Achievements

### 1. GPU Investigation (Complete)
- ✅ Installed PyTorch 2.5.1 + ROCm 6.2
- ✅ Tested GPU compatibility
- ✅ Discovered RX 5700 XT (Navi 10) is NOT supported in modern ROCm
- ✅ Documented findings in 3 comprehensive documents
- ⚠️ System crashed twice during GPU attempts

**Key Finding**: AMD dropped Navi 10 support in ROCm 6.0+. Recent CUDA/ROCm improvements target RDNA2+, RDNA3, and CDNA GPUs only.

### 2. CPU Training Pipeline (Complete)
- ✅ Created production EEG dataset loader with caching
- ✅ Built full training script with checkpointing
- ✅ Created monitoring tools
- ✅ Successfully tested data loading (3,162 windows in ~17s)
- ✅ **Started training in background!**

### 3. Training Status (Running)
- **Process**: train_foundation_cpu.py (PID: 1911078)
- **Progress**: Loading data (40% complete as of 14:05)
- **Model**: Transformer (256 hidden, 8 heads, 4 layers)
- **Data**: 10 HBN subjects
- **ETA**: 6-12 hours for 20 epochs
- **Log**: `logs/training_20251014_140558.log`

## 🔑 Key Decisions

### Decision: Stop GPU, Use CPU ✅
**Why**: 
- RX 5700 XT not in ROCm compatibility matrix
- 2 system crashes wasted time
- Competition evaluates model quality, not training speed

**Result**: 
- Stable training running
- Can complete all P2 tasks
- Focus on what matters

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Tonight
- ✅ Training runs overnight automatically
- ✅ Checkpoints save every 5 epochs
- ✅ Best model auto-saved

### Tomorrow Morning
1. Check training completion
2. Evaluate model performance
3. Start Challenge 1 & 2 implementation
4. Download more subjects if needed

### This Week
1. Implement Challenge 1 (transfer learning to CCD)
2. Implement Challenge 2 (P-factors regression)
3. Optimize inference (<50ms target)
4. Submit to competition

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **GPU Compatibility Matters**: Always check before assuming it works
2. **Document Decisions**: Future you will thank you
3. **Backup Plans**: CPU training saved the project
4. **Focus on Goals**: Model quality > training speed
5. **Caching is Essential**: 17s vs 5+ minutes for data loading
