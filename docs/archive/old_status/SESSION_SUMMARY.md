# Session Summary - October 14, 2025 (Phase 2 Kickoff)

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully moved to next phase of EEG competition project with GPU safeguards and foundation model training ACTIVE!

## ✅ Major Achievements

### 1. GPU Crash Prevention System ⚡
**Problem**: GPU kept crashing system (RX 5700 XT + ROCm incompatibility)

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Timeout-protected GPU testing (multiprocessing with 10s timeout)
- ✅ Automatic CPU fallback on GPU hang/crash
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ System stability preserved

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/train_gpu_safeguarded.py` - First safeguard attempt
- `scripts/train_gpu_timeout.py` - Timeout protection (working!)
- `docs/GPU_SAFEGUARDS_SUMMARY.md` - Documentation
- `docs/GPU_FALLBACK_DECISION.md` - Decision rationale

### 2. Reliable Dataset Infrastructure 📊
**Created**: `scripts/models/eeg_dataset_simple.py`

**Features**:
- Loads EEG data from HBN dataset (BIDS format)
- MNE-Python integration for .set files
- Preprocessing: bandpass filter, resampling
- Sliding window extraction (2s windows)
- Dummy labels for self-supervised training
- PyTorch Dataset compatible

**Stats**:
- 12 HBN subjects with EEG
- ~3000+ windows (2-second segments)
- 129 channels × 1000 timepoints per window

### 3. Foundation Model Training 🧠
**Model**: FoundationTransformer
- Architecture: Transformer encoder
- Hidden dim: 128
- Attention heads: 8
- Layers: 4
- Parameters: ~5M (~20 MB)
- Feedforward: 4x expansion (512 dim)
- Global average pooling + classifier

**Training Configuration**:
- Device: CPU (stable, GPU crashes prevented)
- Batch size: 16
- Epochs: 20
- Learning rate: 1e-4 with AdamW
- Gradient clipping: 1.0
- Checkpoints: Every 2 epochs + best model
- Data split: 80% train / 20% validation

**Status**: 
- ✅ RUNNING (PID: 2070583)
- 📁 Log: `logs/foundation_cpu_20251014_154032.log`
- ⏱️ ETA: ~2-4 hours

### 4. Monitoring & Documentation 📝
**Tools Created**:
- `monitor_training.sh` - Real-time training monitor
- `PROGRESS_UPDATE.md` - Progress tracking

- [ ] Implement Challenge 2 (Sex)
```

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: CPU Training (Not GPU)
**Rationale**:
- RX 5700 XT not officially supported in ROCm 6.2+
- System crashes confirmed (2+ incidents)
- CPU training proven stable
- Model size manageable on CPU (~5M params)
- Training time acceptable (2-4 hours)

**Trade-off**: Longer training time vs system stability

### Decision 2: Simple Dataset Loader
**Rationale**:
- Complex loaders caused VS Code crashes
- Simple = maintainable + debuggable
- Focus on working solution
- Can optimize later if needed

### Decision 3: Incremental Scripts
**Rationale**:
- Breaking large scripts into smaller parts
- Prevents VS Code/system crashes
- Easier to debug
- Better for resource-constrained environment

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **GPU Hardware Limits**: Can't fix hardware incompatibility with software
2. **Safeguards Are Essential**: Timeout protection prevents cascading failures
3. **Incremental Development**: Small steps prevent crashes and enable debugging
4. **Documentation Matters**: Clear docs help resume after crashes/interruptions
5. **CPU Is Viable**: Modern CPUs can handle small-to-medium models effectively

## 🔔 Important Notes

### For Next Session:
1. Check if training completed: `ps aux | grep train_foundation_cpu`
2. Review logs: `tail -100 logs/foundation_cpu_*.log`
3. Load best model: `checkpoints/foundation_best.pth`
4. See `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for commands

### If VS Code Crashes:
- Training continues in background!
- Reopen VS Code
- Run `./monitor_training.sh`
- Continue from where you left off

### If System Crashes:
- Training may stop (check process)
- Restart training: See `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
