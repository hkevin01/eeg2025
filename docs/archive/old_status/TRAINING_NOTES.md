# Training Notes & Optimization

## Current Training Status

**Started**: 2025-10-14 14:05  
**Configuration**:
- Epochs: 20
- Batch size: 16
- Time per batch: ~11 seconds
- Batches per epoch: 1,374
- **Time per epoch**: ~4.3 hours
- **Total time**: ~86 hours (3.6 days!)

## ⚠️ Issue: Training Too Slow

The current configuration will take **3.6 days** to complete, which is too long!

## 🔧 Solutions for Tomorrow

### Option 1: Stop and Restart with Optimized Config ⭐
**Best approach**: Kill current training, restart with better config

```bash
# Kill current training
pkill -f train_foundation_cpu.py

# Edit config in scripts/train_foundation_cpu.py:
# - epochs: 20 → 5 (fewer epochs)
# - batch_size: 16 → 32 (larger batches)
# - learning_rate: 1e-4 → 2e-4 (faster learning)

# Restart
nohup python3 scripts/train_foundation_cpu.py > logs/training_optimized.log 2>&1 &
```

**New time estimate**: ~2 hours per epoch × 5 epochs = **10 hours total** ✅

### Option 2: Let Current Training Run for 1-2 Epochs
**Compromise**: See results from 1-2 epochs, then decide

```bash
# Check after 4-8 hours
bash scripts/monitor_training.sh

# If good results after 1-2 epochs:
# - Kill training
# - Use checkpoint_epoch_5.pth or best_model.pth
# - Move forward with challenges
```

### Option 3: Use Subset of Data
**Fast iteration**: Train on fewer subjects first

```bash
# Edit config:
# max_subjects: 10 → 3

# Time: ~30 minutes per epoch × 5 epochs = 2.5 hours
```

## 📊 Recommended Plan for Tomorrow

### Morning (Check Status)
1. Check training progress
2. If <5 epochs complete: **Kill and restart with optimized config**
3. If 1-2 epochs complete: **Use checkpoint and move forward**

### Why Restart is OK
- We have caching (data loads fast)
- Better config = better results faster
- Competition needs working model, not perfect model
- Can always train more later

### Optimized Config
```python
CONFIG = {
    'max_subjects': 5,  # Faster for iteration
    'epochs': 5,  # Sufficient for good model
    'batch_size': 32,  # 2x faster
    'learning_rate': 2e-4,  # 2x faster convergence
}
```

**New time**: ~1-2 hours total! ✅

## 🎯 Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Action | Time | Result |
|----------|--------|------|--------|
| Training at epoch 0-1 | Restart optimized | +2h | Better config, faster |
| Training at epoch 2-5 | Use checkpoint | 0h | Move to challenges |
| Training at epoch 5+ | Use best model | 0h | Already good enough |

## 💡 Key Insight

**For competitions**: 
- A working model in 2 hours > perfect model in 4 days
- Can always improve later
- Focus on completing all challenges first

## 📞 Tomorrow's First Command

```bash
# Check status
bash scripts/monitor_training.sh

# If still at early epochs, run:
# Option A: Restart optimized (recommended)
pkill -f train_foundation_cpu
python3 scripts/train_foundation_cpu.py  # with edited config

# Option B: Continue and use checkpoint
# Just wait for next checkpoint at epoch 5
```

---

**Bottom Line**: Don't wait 3.6 days. Either restart with optimized config (2 hours) or use checkpoint after 1-2 epochs tomorrow!
