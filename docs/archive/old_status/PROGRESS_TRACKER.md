## üõ†Ô∏è VS Code Optimizations Implemented

### Performance Settings
‚úÖ **File Watcher Exclusions**
- Excludes: `data/`, `logs/`, `outputs/`, `checkpoints/`
- Reduces VS Code CPU/memory usage during training

‚úÖ **Search Exclusions**
- Excludes large directories from search
- Faster file searching

‚úÖ **Terminal Settings**
- Scrollback: 10,000 lines
- Persistent sessions enabled
- Better for long-running processes

‚úÖ **Editor Performance**
- Large file optimizations enabled
- Auto-save every 30 seconds
- Prevents data loss during long processes

‚úÖ **Git Settings**
- Large file threshold: 50 MB
- Auto-fetch disabled (reduces background load)

### Files Created
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code workspace settings
- `.gitignore` - Prevents tracking large files
- `monitor_advanced.sh` - Live training monitor

---

## üìä Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next 2-3 hours)
**Status:** ‚è≥ **WAITING FOR TRAINING**

1. **Monitor Training**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Advanced monitor (recommended)
   ./monitor_advanced.sh
   
   # Option 2: Simple monitor
   watch -n 5 'ps aux | grep python | grep train'
   
   # Option 3: Check logs
   tail -f logs/foundation_full_*.log
   ```

2. **Let Training Complete**
   - Current: Epoch 1/10
   - Expected: ~2-3 hours for 10 epochs
   - Do not interrupt!

3. **Prepare Challenge 1 Scripts**
   - Create `scripts/challenge1_age_prediction.py`
   - Prepare data loading pipeline
   - Set up evaluation metrics

### After Training Completes

1. **Verify Foundation Model** (30 minutes)
   - Check training completed successfully
   - Review final metrics
   - Test model loading
   - Verify checkpoint exists

2. **Implement Challenge 1** (2-3 hours)
   - Load pretrained model
   - Add regression head
   - Fine-tune on age data
   - Evaluate and submit

3. **Implement Challenge 2** (2-3 hours)
   - Reuse foundation model
   - Add classification head
   - Fine-tune on sex data
   - Evaluate and submit

## üéÆ Available Commands

### Monitoring
```bash
# Advanced live monitor
./monitor_advanced.sh

# Simple process check
ps aux | grep python | grep train

# Check logs
tail -f logs/foundation_full_*.log

# Check system resources
htop  # or top
free -h
df -h
```

### Training Control
```bash
# Check if training is running
pgrep -f train_simple.py

# View process details
ps -p <PID> -o pid,etime,%cpu,%mem,cmd

# Emergency stop (if needed)
pkill -f train_simple.py
```

### After Training
```bash
# List checkpoints
ls -lh checkpoints/

# Check best model
ls -lh checkpoints/*best*.pth

# View training history
python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('logs/training_history.json')))"
```
