# Current Status - LIVE

**Last Updated**: October 14, 2025 15:43

## 🏃 ACTIVE TRAINING

**Process**: Foundation Model Training (CPU)
- **PID**: 2070583
- **Status**: RUNNING
- **CPU Usage**: 99.6%
- **RAM Usage**: 20.8 GB
- **Current Stage**: Loading dataset (normal, takes 2-5 min)
- **Log**: `logs/foundation_cpu_20251014_154032.log`

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Started**: 15:40 (Oct 14, 2025)
- **Running Time**: ~3 minutes
- **Expected Total**: 2-4 hours
- **Estimated Completion**: ~17:40-19:40 today

## 📊 What's Happening Now

1. ✅ Process started successfully
2. 🔄 Loading EEG dataset (12 subjects, ~3000 windows)
   - This step takes 2-5 minutes
   - High RAM usage is normal (loading all EEG data)
3. ⏳ After loading: Training will begin
4. ⏳ Checkpoints will save every 2 epochs

## 🔍 How to Monitor

```bash
# Quick check
./monitor_training.sh

# Watch log in real-time
tail -f logs/foundation_cpu_20251014_154032.log

# Check process
ps aux | grep train_foundation_cpu | grep -v grep
```

## 📝 Expected Log Sequence

1. ✅ "🚀 Foundation Model Training (CPU)"
2. ✅ "📁 Device: CPU"
3. 🔄 "📂 Loading Dataset..." ← **CURRENTLY HERE**
4. ⏳ "   Total: ~3000 windows"
5. ⏳ "🧠 Creating Model..."
6. ⏳ "🏋️  Training Started"
7. ⏳ "Epoch 1/20"
8. ⏳ ... training progress ...

## ✅ Everything is Normal

- High CPU usage (99%) = expected (CPU training)
- High RAM usage (20GB) = expected (loading EEG data)
- Log not updating = buffering (will flush after dataset loads)
- Process alive = training ongoing

## 🚨 Only Worry If

- Process disappears (check with `ps aux | grep train`)
- Log shows error messages
- System becomes unresponsive (shouldn't happen with CPU)

## 📞 Quick Actions

### To Check Status
```bash
./monitor_training.sh
```

### To View Live Log
```bash
tail -f logs/foundation_cpu_20251014_154032.log
```

### To Stop (if needed)
```bash
pkill -f train_foundation_cpu
```

### To Restart (if crashed)
```bash
nohup python3 -u scripts/train_foundation_cpu.py > logs/foundation_cpu_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &
```

## 🎯 Next Checkpoint

Check back in ~10-15 minutes to see Epoch 1 progress!
