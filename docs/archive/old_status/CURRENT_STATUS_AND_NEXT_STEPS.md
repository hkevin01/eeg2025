## ‚úÖ Completed Today

### 1. VS Code Optimization ‚úÖ
- **Removed resource-heavy extensions:**
  - ‚ùå Pylint (was using 83% CPU)
  - ‚ùå Mypy (was using 98% CPU!)
  - ‚ùå Pylance (was using 125%+ CPU!)
  - ‚ùå Flake8, Autopep8, Black, Isort
- **Created optimized settings:** `.vscode/settings.json`
  - Disabled linting during training
  - Reduced file watching overhead
  - Optimized terminal output
  - Excluded large directories from search
- **Result:** VS Code should no longer crash/freeze during training

### 2. GPU Safety System ‚úÖ
- **Created ultra-safe GPU test:** `scripts/gpu_ultra_safe_test.py`
- **Created monitored wrapper:** `scripts/run_gpu_test_monitored.sh`
- **Comprehensive documentation:**
  - `GPU_SAFETY_GUIDE.md`
  - `GPU_TEST_STATUS.md`
  - `FINAL_SUMMARY.md`
- **Decision:** GPU not reliable, CPU training recommended

### 3. Training Scripts Created ‚úÖ
- **Foundation training:** `scripts/train_simple.py`
- **Minimal training:** `scripts/train_minimal.py` (5K samples, 5 epochs)
- **Challenge 1:** `scripts/train_challenge1.py` (created, not run)
- **Dataset loader:** `scripts/models/eeg_dataset_simple.py` ‚úÖ Working

---

## üéØ Current Situation

### Training Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT RUNNING
- All previous training processes were killed/stopped
- No completed training yet
- Small checkpoint exists: `checkpoints/cpu_timeout_model.pth` (27KB - too small)

### Why Training Keeps Stopping
1. **VS Code was crashing** ‚Üí FIXED (removed heavy extensions)
2. **Multiple processes competing** ‚Üí FIXED (killed duplicates)
3. **Training interrupted manually** ‚Üí Need uninterrupted run

### System Resources: ‚úÖ GOOD
- **RAM:** 24GB free (of 31GB)
- **CPU:** Available
- **Disk:** 120GB free
- **No resource constraints**

---

## üìã Next Steps (Clear Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Complete Foundation Training ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Option A: Quick Training (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
# Run minimal training (5K samples, 5 epochs, ~10-15 minutes)
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
python3 scripts/train_minimal.py | tee logs/minimal_run_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log
```
**Pros:**
- Completes quickly (10-15 min)
- Creates usable checkpoint
- Can test Challenge 1 pipeline
- Low risk of interruption

**Cons:**
- Not full dataset
- May have lower performance

---

**Option B: Full Training**
```bash
# Run full training (38K samples, 10 epochs, ~2-4 hours)
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
nohup python3 scripts/train_simple.py > logs/full_run_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &

# Monitor with:
tail -f logs/full_run_*.log
```
**Pros:**
- Full dataset
- Better performance
- Production-ready model

**Cons:**
- Takes 2-4 hours
- Higher risk of interruption
- Need to leave running

---

### Priority 2: Implement Challenge 1 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**After training completes:**

1. **Load trained model**
   ```python
   checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoints/minimal_best.pth')  # or full model
   model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
   ```

2. **Run Challenge 1 training**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/train_challenge1.py
   ```

3. **Generate submission**
   - Predictions saved to: `submissions/challenge1_predictions.csv`
   - Format: `participant_id, age_prediction`

4. **Evaluate locally**
   - Check Pearson r > 0.3
   - Check AUROC > 0.7

---

### Priority 3: Implement Challenge 2 ‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Similar to Challenge 1:**

1. Create `scripts/train_challenge2.py` (sex classification)
2. Use same foundation model
3. Add classification head
4. Generate submission

---

### Priority 4: Submit to Competition ‚≠ê

1. Test both submissions locally
2. Upload to competition platform
3. Monitor leaderboard

---

## üé¨ Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes):
```bash
# 1. Start minimal training
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
python3 scripts/train_minimal.py | tee logs/minimal_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log

# This will:
# - Complete in 10-15 minutes
# - Create checkpoint: checkpoints/minimal_best.pth
# - Save history: logs/minimal_history.json
```

### After Training (Next 1 hour):
```bash
# 2. Test model loading
python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.load('checkpoints/minimal_best.pth').keys())"

# 3. Run Challenge 1
python3 scripts/train_challenge1.py

# 4. Check submission
ls -lh submissions/challenge1_predictions.csv
```

### Later (If time permits):
```bash
# 5. Run full training for better performance
nohup python3 scripts/train_simple.py > logs/full_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &

# 6. Implement Challenge 2
# 7. Generate both submissions
# 8. Submit to competition
```

## üìä Decision Matrix

| Option | Time | Performance | Risk | Recommended |
|--------|------|-------------|------|-------------|
| Minimal Training | 10-15 min | Good | Low | ‚úÖ YES (start here) |
| Full Training | 2-4 hours | Better | Medium | ‚ö†Ô∏è Later |
| Challenge 1 | 30 min | N/A | Low | ‚úÖ After training |
| Challenge 2 | 30 min | N/A | Low | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional |

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable:
- [x] VS Code optimized
- [ ] **Foundation model trained** ‚Üê NEXT
- [ ] **Challenge 1 submission created**
- [ ] Model checkpoint saved

### Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Full dataset training
- [ ] Challenge 2 submission

## üöÄ Quick Start Command

**Run this now to start training:**
```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
python3 scripts/train_minimal.py 2>&1 | tee logs/train_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log
```

**Expected output:**
1. Loading 5000 samples (30 seconds)
2. Training 5 epochs (10-12 minutes)
3. Saving checkpoint
4. Completion message

**After completion:**
- Checkpoint: `checkpoints/minimal_best.pth`
- History: `logs/minimal_history.json`
- Ready for Challenge 1!

## üìù Notes

- VS Code should no longer crash (extensions removed)
- Training is CPU-only (safe and stable)
- Minimal training is fast and reliable
- Can upgrade to full training later
- All scripts are ready to use

---

**Next Action:** Run the minimal training script!
