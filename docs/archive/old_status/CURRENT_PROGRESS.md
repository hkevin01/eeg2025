## üîç Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check training status
./monitor_foundation.sh

# Watch live progress
tail -f logs/foundation_full_20251014_164006.log

# Check process
ps aux | grep train_simple

# Check GPU/CPU usage
htop

# Check disk space
df -h

# List checkpoints
ls -lh checkpoints/
```

---

## üí° Next Actions (Automated)

When foundation training completes:
1. Check final metrics in log
2. Verify `checkpoints/foundation_best.pth` exists
3. Start Challenge 1 training automatically (if using automation)
4. Or manually run: `python3 scripts/challenge1_age_prediction.py`

## üìù Notes

### Data Available
- **Subjects:** 12 subjects with EEG data
- **Total Windows:** ~38,000 (estimated)
- **Format:** BIDS-compliant .set files
- **Labels:** participants.tsv (age, sex, etc.)

### Hardware
- **Device:** CPU (AMD Ryzen, 32GB RAM)
- **GPU:** AMD RX 5700 XT (incompatible, not used)
- **Training Speed:** ~30-45 min/epoch for full dataset

### Known Issues

## üöÄ Quick Start (If You Want to Jump In)

### Check Current Status
```bash
./monitor_foundation.sh
```

### If Training Stopped
```bash
# Restart training
nohup python3 scripts/train_simple.py > logs/foundation_restart_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &
```

### When Foundation Completes
```bash
# Check results
ls -lh checkpoints/foundation_best.pth
cat logs/history_*.json

# Start Challenge 1
python3 scripts/challenge1_age_prediction.py
```
