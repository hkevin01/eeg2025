## üìã Current Todo List

```markdown
### Phase 1: Training (ACTIVE) üîÑ

- [x] Fixed all 6 critical bugs
- [x] Restarted Challenge 1 v5 with correct metadata field
- [x] Verified Challenge 2 has diverse training targets
- [x] Both trainings active and progressing
- [ ] **Monitor Epoch 1 completion (ETA: ~30 min)**
- [ ] **Verify NRMSE values are reasonable (not 0.0)**

### Phase 2: Training Completion (~2-3 hours)

- [ ] Challenge 1 reaches convergence
- [ ] Challenge 2 reaches convergence
- [ ] Validation NRMSE stabilizes
- [ ] Early stopping triggers or 50 epochs complete
- [ ] Check best validation NRMSE for both challenges

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation

- [ ] Test submission.py loads both models
- [ ] Verify prediction shapes are correct
- [ ] Check for any NumPy compatibility issues
- [ ] Validate models work on sample data

### Phase 4: Submission Package

- [ ] Create submission.zip with:
  - [ ] submission.py
  - [ ] weights_challenge_1_multi_release.pt
  - [ ] weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt
  - [ ] METHODS_DOCUMENT.pdf (convert from .md)
- [ ] Verify zip file < size limit
- [ ] Test extraction and file integrity

### Phase 5: Upload to Competition

- [ ] Upload submission.zip to Codabench
- [ ] Wait for evaluation results
- [ ] Compare with previous submission (2.01 NRMSE)
- [ ] If results good: DONE! üéâ
- [ ] If results not good enough: Proceed to Phase 2 features

### Phase 6: Advanced Features (If Needed)

- [ ] Challenge 1: Implement P300 component extraction
- [ ] Challenge 2: Add spectral band features (alpha, beta, theta)
- [ ] Retrain with enhanced features
- [ ] Expected improvement: 0.8 ‚Üí 0.5 NRMSE
```

## üéØ Current Training Status

### Challenge 1: Response Time Prediction
- **Status:** üîÑ Epoch 1/50 (data loading/first batch)
- **Log:** `logs/challenge1_training_v5.log`
- **Fix Applied:** Using `rt_from_stimulus` from metadata ‚úÖ
- **Training Data:** R1-R4 (multi-release)
- **Validation:** R5
- **Model:** CompactResponseTimeCNN (200K params)

### Challenge 2: Externalizing Factor Prediction
- **Status:** üîÑ Epoch 3/50 (ACTIVE TRAINING)
- **Log:** `logs/challenge2_training_v6.log`
- **Train NRMSE:** 0.9244 ‚Üí 0.8494 (decreasing ‚úÖ)
- **Val NRMSE:** ~20M (very high - monitoring)
- **Training Data:** R1-R4 (331K windows, diverse scores ‚úÖ)
- **Validation:** R5 (136K windows, all same score)
- **Model:** CompactExternalizingCNN (64K params)

**Note on Challenge 2 Val NRMSE:**  
The validation set (R5) appears to have all windows with the same externalizing score (-0.364). This causes extremely high NRMSE when predictions deviate. This is expected if R5 has homogeneous subjects. Training NRMSE is what matters most.

## üêõ All Bugs Fixed (6 Total)

1. ‚úÖ **Challenge 2 Metadata Crash** - Handle list of dicts format
2. ‚úÖ **submission.py Model Mismatch** - Use Compact models
3. ‚úÖ **Weight Filename Resolution** - Try multi_release first
4. ‚úÖ **Challenge 1 Target Bug** - Extract response_time from metadata
5. ‚úÖ **Challenge 2 Target Bug** - Extract externalizing from description
6. ‚úÖ **Challenge 1 Metadata Field** - Use `rt_from_stimulus` not `response_time`

## üìä Expected Results

### Previous Submission (Single-Release R5)
- Challenge 1: 4.05 NRMSE
- Challenge 2: 1.14 NRMSE
- Overall: 2.01 NRMSE (~5th place)

### Current Submission (Multi-Release R1-R4)
**Expected after fixes:**
- Challenge 1: ~1.4 NRMSE (3x improvement)
- Challenge 2: ~0.5 NRMSE (2x improvement)
- Overall: ~0.8 NRMSE (2.5x better)
- **Goal:** < 0.7 for top 3

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

**Training Started:**
- Challenge 2 v6: 12:30 (3+ hours ago)
- Challenge 1 v5: 13:34 (12 min ago)

**Expected Completion:**
- Challenge 2: ~15:30 (2 hours remaining)
- Challenge 1: ~16:00 (2.5 hours remaining)
- Testing & Package: 16:00-16:30
- **Ready for Submission: ~16:30**

## üéì Key Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify targets!** - Both challenges had NRMSE=0.0 bugs
2. **Check metadata field names** - May differ from documentation
3. **Multi-release training essential** - Single-release fails badly
4. **Smaller models better** - 75% reduction helps generalization
5. **RestingState vs Task data** - Different metadata structures
6. **Validation set homogeneity** - R5 may have same-score subjects
7. **Team participation rules** - Only ONE team per person!

## üîç Next Monitoring Steps

1. **Check every 15 minutes:**
   ```bash
   tail -50 logs/challenge1_training_v5.log | grep -E "Epoch|NRMSE"
   tail -50 logs/challenge2_training_v6.log | grep -E "Epoch|NRMSE"
   ```

2. **Watch for:**
   - Challenge 1: Train NRMSE 0.5-2.0 (NOT 0.0)
   - Challenge 2: Train NRMSE continuing to decrease
   - Early stopping or 50 epochs completion

3. **After training:**
   ```bash
   # Test submission
   python3 submission.py
   
   # Create package
   zip submission_multi_release.zip \
       submission.py \
       weights_challenge_1_multi_release.pt \
       weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt \
       METHODS_DOCUMENT.pdf
   ```
