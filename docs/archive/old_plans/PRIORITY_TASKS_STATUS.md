## üé¨ Monitoring Commands

### Check Training Status
```bash
# Check running processes
ps aux | grep -E "(train_foundation|challenge1)" | grep -v grep

# Monitor foundation training
tail -f logs/foundation_training_*.log

# Monitor Challenge 1 training
tail -f logs/challenge1_*.log

# Check both simultaneously
tail -f logs/foundation_training_*.log logs/challenge1_*.log
```

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# CPU usage (should be high during training)
top -b -n 1 | grep python

# Check logs
ls -lth logs/*.log | head -5

# Check checkpoints
ls -lth checkpoints/*.pth
```

### If Training Hangs
```bash
# Check if processes are alive
ps aux | grep python | grep train

# Kill specific process
kill -9 <PID>

# Kill all Python training
pkill -9 -f train_foundation
pkill -9 -f challenge1
```
