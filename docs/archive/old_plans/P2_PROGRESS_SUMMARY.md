## GPU Training Investigation Results

### Issue Summary
**Problem**: ROCm 6.2 + AMD RX 5700 XT (Navi 10) causes system crashes

4. ❌ Data loading + training - **System crash**

### Options Evaluated
1. ⭐ **CPU Training** - Selected (stable, slower but works)
2. ⚠️ ROCm downgrade - Too risky
3. ⚠️ NVIDIA GPU - Requires hardware purchase
4. ✅ Cloud GPU - Viable for final training
5. ✅ Focus on CPU - Best for competition

## Lessons Learned

1. **GPU Compatibility**: Always check hardware compatibility before assuming GPU will work
2. **Backup Plans**: Having CPU training as backup saved the project
3. **Testing Early**: Found GPU issues early, avoiding wasted effort later
4. **Focus on Goals**: Competition cares about model performance, not training speed
5. **Pragmatic Decisions**: Better to train slower on CPU than fight unstable GPU

## Questions / Blockers

**Q**: Should we try cloud GPU for final training?  
**A**: Maybe - evaluate after CPU training results. If model works well on CPU, may not be necessary.

**Q**: Can we still compete effectively with CPU training?  
**A**: Yes! Model quality matters most. Many winners train on CPU or small GPUs.

**Q**: How long will CPU training take?  
**A**: Estimated 12-24 hours for full model. Can run overnight.
