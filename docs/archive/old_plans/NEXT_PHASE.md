# Next Phase: Foundation Model Training (P2)

## Current Status
- ✅ GPU safeguards implemented (auto-fallback to CPU)
- ✅ Dataset loader working (SimpleEEGDataset)
- ✅ Small test training completed successfully
- ⭐ Ready to scale up!

## Next Steps (Small Incremental Tasks)

### Step 1: Download More Data
- [x] Have 12 HBN subjects with EEG (sufficient to start)
- [x] Verified data integrity (all loading correctly)
- [x] Total: ~3000+ windows available

### Step 2: Scale Up Model Size
- [x] Increased hidden_dim from 64 to 128
- [x] Increased layers from 2 to 4
- [x] Tested on small subset successfully

### Step 3: Full Training Run (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Training on all 12 subjects (~3000+ windows)
- [x] Running now (PID: 2070583)
- [x] Checkpoints saving every 2 epochs
- [ ] Wait for completion (~2-4 hours)

### Step 4: Validation & Analysis
- [ ] Evaluate model performance
- [ ] Create training curves
- [ ] Document results

### Step 5: Move to Challenges
- [ ] Implement Challenge 1 (Age Prediction)
- [ ] Implement Challenge 2 (Sex Classification)
