# GPU Safety Testing Guide

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Your GPU has been causing system crashes/blackouts**

This guide provides a safe way to test GPU compatibility without crashing your system.

## Safety Features Implemented

### 1. Ultra-Safe Test Script (`scripts/gpu_ultra_safe_test.py`)
- **Progressive testing**: Tests get more complex step-by-step
- **Timeout protection**: Each test has a timeout (5-15s)
- **Early termination**: Stops at first sign of trouble
- **Minimal operations**: Only 5x5 tensors initially
- **No training**: Just basic GPU operations

### 2. Monitored Wrapper (`scripts/run_gpu_test_monitored.sh`)
- **External timeout**: Kills process after 120s
- **Logging**: All output saved to log file
- **Abort option**: 3-second countdown to abort
- **Clear reporting**: Success/failure clearly indicated

## How to Run the Safe Test

```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
./scripts/run_gpu_test_monitored.sh
```

### What to Expect

1. **3-second countdown**: Press Ctrl+C to abort if needed
2. **Progressive tests**: 8 tests run sequentially
3. **Each test has timeout**: 5-15 seconds max per test
4. **Stops on failure**: Won't continue if any test fails/hangs
5. **Total max time**: 2 minutes (120s external timeout)

### Test Sequence

1. ‚úÖ Import PyTorch (5s timeout)
2. ‚úÖ Check CUDA availability (5s timeout)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Get GPU device name (10s timeout) - **May hang here**
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Create device object (5s timeout)
5. ‚úÖ Create CPU tensor (5s timeout)
6. üî¥ Create TINY GPU tensor 5x5 (15s timeout) - **CRITICAL**
7. üî¥ Tiny GPU matmul 5x5 (15s timeout) - **CRITICAL**
8. ‚ö†Ô∏è Move GPU‚ÜíCPU (10s timeout)

### Interpreting Results

#### ‚úÖ ALL 8 TESTS PASS
- GPU works for basic operations
- **However**: Full training may still crash
- **Recommendation**: Test with very small model first

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è 5-7 TESTS PASS
- GPU partially works
- Likely hangs on actual operations
- **Recommendation**: DO NOT attempt training
- **Recommendation**: Use CPU (already running)

#### ‚ùå 0-4 TESTS PASS
- GPU not compatible
- System likely to crash on GPU use
- **Recommendation**: CPU only

## Current Status

### CPU Training: ‚úÖ RUNNING (Safe & Stable)
- Process: `train_foundation_cpu.py`
- Status: Active, loading dataset
- Device: CPU
- No crash risk

### GPU Testing: ‚ö†Ô∏è READY TO TEST
- Ultra-safe script: Created
- Monitored wrapper: Created
- Guardrails: Multiple layers
- Risk: Minimized (but not zero)

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Test GPU (With Caution)
```bash
# Run the monitored test
./scripts/run_gpu_test_monitored.sh

# Watch output carefully
# Press Ctrl+C if system shows any instability
```

### Option 2: Skip GPU (Safest)
- CPU training is already running
- CPU is stable and proven working
- Will complete in 2-4 hours
- No crash risk

## What We Know

### From OpenNLP-GPU Analysis
- Your `opennlp-gpu` project works with same hardware
- Uses same environment variables (HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0)
- Has graceful CPU fallback
- Focus is on CPU for production

### From Previous Tests
- `check_gpu.py` showed "GPU READY"
- Basic tensor operations (10x10, 100x100) worked
- But full training caused crashes
- Issue: RX 5700 XT + ROCm 6.2 incompatibility

### The Problem
- AMD RX 5700 XT (gfx1010/Navi 10)
- Not officially supported in ROCm 6.0+
- hipBLASLt not available (uses fallback)
- Can work for basic ops but unstable for training

## Decision Tree

```
Do you need GPU urgently?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Run monitored test
‚îÇ         ‚îú‚îÄ All pass ‚Üí Try tiny training test
‚îÇ         ‚îî‚îÄ Any fail ‚Üí Use CPU
‚îî‚îÄ NO  ‚Üí Let CPU training continue (RECOMMENDED)
          ‚îú‚îÄ Safe and stable
          ‚îú‚îÄ Will complete in 2-4 hours
          ‚îî‚îÄ Can test GPU later if needed
```

## Emergency Procedures

### If System Starts to Hang
1. **Immediately press Ctrl+C**
2. If unresponsive, switch to TTY (Ctrl+Alt+F2)
3. Login and run: `pkill -9 python3`
4. Reboot if necessary

### If System Blacks Out
1. Hard reset (power button)
2. After reboot, check logs: `logs/gpu_safe_test_*.log`
3. **DO NOT** attempt GPU training again
4. Use CPU exclusively

## Files Created

- `scripts/gpu_ultra_safe_test.py` - Progressive GPU test (305 lines)
- `scripts/run_gpu_test_monitored.sh` - Monitored wrapper (50 lines)
- `GPU_SAFETY_GUIDE.md` - This guide

## Next Steps

Choose one:

### A. Test GPU (Cautious)
```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
./scripts/run_gpu_test_monitored.sh
# Watch for any signs of hang
# Press Ctrl+C if concerned
```

### B. Continue with CPU (Safe) ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
```bash
# Monitor CPU training
./monitor_training.sh

# Training will complete in ~2-4 hours
# Can work on other tasks meanwhile
```

## Summary

**Safe Path**: Let CPU training finish ‚Üí Then decide about GPU
**Risky Path**: Test GPU now ‚Üí May crash system ‚Üí May learn if GPU usable

**Your choice!** Both options documented and ready.
