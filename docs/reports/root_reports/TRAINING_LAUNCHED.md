- **Estimated time per epoch:** ~2-3 hours (CPU)
- **Total estimated time:** 12-24 hours

### 📝 Log Files

- **Main log:** `logs/training_cpu_20251020_132732.log`
- **PID file:** `logs/training.pid`
- **Monitor command:** `tail -f logs/training_cpu_20251020_132732.log`

### 🔍 Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Watch training progress
tail -f logs/training_cpu_20251020_132732.log

# Check process status
ps aux | grep "python.*train_challenge2" | grep -v grep

# Quick monitor
./scripts/monitoring/watch_training_simple.sh
```

### 🎉 Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ All ROCm environment warnings fixed
2. ✅ GPU health check passing (simple operations)
3. ✅ Data loading successful (129k windows)
4. ✅ Model creation successful (62k params)
5. ✅ Training loop started
6. ✅ CPU fallback active and stable
7. ✅ Multi-process data loading (4 workers @ 99% CPU)

### 📈 Next Milestones

- [ ] Complete Epoch 1 (~2-3 hours)
- [ ] Validate on val set
- [ ] Save first checkpoint
- [ ] Continue through 20 epochs
- [ ] Generate final weights for submission

### 🚨 What to Watch For

1. **Memory usage** - Should stay under 16GB RAM
2. **CPU temperature** - Monitor if system gets hot
3. **Disk I/O** - HDF5 cache access patterns
4. **Progress logging** - Should see batch updates every 25 batches

### 💡 Recommendations

**Short-term (Tonight):**
- Let training run overnight
- Check progress in morning
- Expect 5-10 epochs complete by morning

**Medium-term (This week):**
- Consider parallel cloud GPU training for speed
- Compare CPU vs GPU results
- Prepare submission package

### 📚 Documentation Created

1. `ROCM_TRAINING_STATUS.md` - Comprehensive ROCm analysis
2. `docs/rocm_troubleshooting.md` - Troubleshooting guide
3. `docs/model_control_plane.md` - MCP documentation
4. `scripts/setup_rocm_env.sh` - Environment configuration
5. `scripts/check_rocm_health.sh` - Health diagnostic
6. `scripts/train_challenge2_optimized.sh` - Training launcher

### 🏆 Competition Timeline

- **Today:** Training started ✅
- **Oct 21-31:** Complete training, validate results
- **Nov 1:** Final testing and submission prep
- **Nov 2:** **DEADLINE** - Submit to competition
- **Buffer:** 13 days remaining - plenty of time!

## Summary

**Status:** ✅ **TRAINING IS RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY**

The Challenge 2 model is now training on CPU with the fallback mechanism. 
While GPU had compatibility issues (RX 5600 XT gfx1010 not fully supported), 
the CPU training is stable and will complete in 12-24 hours.

All environment issues have been resolved, comprehensive documentation created,
and the path to competition submission is clear.

**Recommendation:** Let this run overnight, monitor in the morning, and consider 
parallel cloud GPU training for faster iteration if needed.
