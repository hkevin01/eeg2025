## 🎯 Performance Summary

### Challenge 1 Progress

| Version | Model | Seeds | Val NRMSE | Competition Score | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| V10 | CompactCNN | 1 | Unknown | 1.00019 | Baseline |
| **V11.5** | EnhancedCompactCNN | 5 | 1.499130 | **TBD** | Phase 1 aggressive |

**Uncertainty:** Internal validation NRMSE (1.499) may not directly translate to competition metric. Competition baseline is ≥1.0, suggesting different normalization.

### Challenge 2 Progress

| Version | Model | Seeds | Val Loss | Competition Score | Improvement |
|---------|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| V10 | EEGNeX | 1 | 0.252 | 1.00066 | Baseline |
| **V11/V11.5** | EEGNeX | 2 | 0.124205 | **1.00049** | 50.7% better |

## 💡 Key Insights

### Training Speed
- **Surprise:** C1 Phase 1 training completed in 11.2 minutes, not 41 hours!
- **Reason:** Small dataset (7,461 samples), efficient architecture (75K params)
- **Impact:** Enables rapid experimentation and iteration

### Ensemble Quality
- **C1:** CV 0.62% (excellent consistency across 5 seeds)
- **C2:** CV 1.39% (good consistency across 2 seeds)
- **Learning:** EMA + aggressive augmentation → diverse yet consistent models

### GPU Stability
- **Issue:** ROCm memory faults persist ("Memory access fault by GPU node-1")
- **Workaround:** CPU training viable for small models
- **Impact:** ~6x slower but reliable for production submissions

### Normalization Mystery
- **Observation:** V10 C1 score (1.00019) vs validation NRMSE (1.499) huge difference
- **Hypothesis:** Competition uses different normalization or metric calculation
- **Risk:** V11.5 C1 improvement magnitude unknown until tested
- **Mitigation:** Upload both V11 (safe) and V11.5 (aggressive) to test

## 📈 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today, Nov 1)
- [ ] Upload **V11** to competition (safe bet)
- [ ] Upload **V11.5** to competition (test C1 improvement)
- [ ] Monitor leaderboard for results (~1-2 hours)
- [ ] Analyze V11.5 C1 performance vs V10 baseline
- [ ] Document lessons learned from score comparison

### Short-term (Nov 2-3)
- [ ] Analyze V11.5 results to understand competition normalization
- [ ] If C1 improved significantly: proceed with Phase 2
- [ ] If C1 unchanged/worse: debug normalization mismatch
- [ ] Consider training C1 with different loss function (match competition metric)

### Mid-term (Nov 4-6) - Phase 2
If V11.5 shows C1 improvement:
- [ ] Research transformer architectures for EEG
- [ ] Implement temporal transformer model
- [ ] Train 3 architectures × 3 seeds (CNN, Transformer, ResNet)
- [ ] Create multi-architecture ensemble
- [ ] Target: C1 improvement to 0.96-0.97 range

### Long-term (Nov 7-8) - Phase 3
If Phase 2 successful:
- [ ] Implement pseudo-labeling with unlabeled data
- [ ] Knowledge distillation (teacher-student)
- [ ] Advanced ensemble with stacking
- [ ] Subject-level calibration
- [ ] Target: Top 20 ranking (0.92-0.95 range)

## 🔍 Open Questions

1. **C1 Normalization:** How does internal val NRMSE (1.499) map to competition score?
2. **Ensemble vs Single:** Does 5-seed ensemble outperform best single model?
3. **Architecture Impact:** Can different architectures (transformer) improve further?
4. **Data Augmentation:** Are there additional augmentations that could help?
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Can we optimize dropout, learning rate, etc. further?

**Resolution Strategy:** Upload V11.5 and analyze results to answer these questions.
