## What Was Done Today

### 1. Root Cause Analysis ✅

- Created V10 with correct format → SUCCESS!
- V10 score: 1.00052, rank #72

### 2. Strategy Refinement ✅
- Received expert guidance on variance reduction
- Key insight: NRMSE ≥ 1.0, focus on reducing variance
- Prioritized: C2 ensemble (bigger ROI) → C1 multi-seed

### 3. Implementation ✅
- Created C2 Phase 2 training with EMA
- Created C1 multi-seed training with EMA
- Implemented conservative augmentation
- Added proper early stopping & LR scheduling

### 4. Execution ✅
- Launched C2 Phase 2 training
- Documented variance reduction strategy
- Created comprehensive execution plan

## Monitoring Commands

### Check C2 Training Progress
```bash
# Real-time monitoring
tail -f /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025/logs/c2_phase2_ema_cpu.log

# Check latest status
tail -30 /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025/logs/c2_phase2_ema_cpu.log

# Check if complete
ls -lh /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025/checkpoints/c2_phase2_seed*_ema_best.pt

# Count checkpoints (should be 5)
ls /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025/checkpoints/c2_phase2_seed*_ema_best.pt | wc -l
```

### Verify Training Success
```bash
# Extract validation losses
grep "Best:" /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025/logs/c2_phase2_ema_cpu.log | tail -5

# Check for early stopping
grep "Early stopping" /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025/logs/c2_phase2_ema_cpu.log

# Check final summary
grep "Ensemble Statistics" -A 5 /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025/logs/c2_phase2_ema_cpu.log
```

## Risk Mitigation

### GPU Stability Issues ✅
- Issue: ROCm memory faults during training
- Solution: Forced CPU training
- Impact: Training slower but reliable

### Data Loading ✅
- Issue: Initial path errors
- Solution: Fixed to `data/raw/ds005509-bdf`
- Verified: 33,316 train + 5,782 val segments loaded

### Validation Stability ✅
- Fixed random seeds for data loaders
- Deterministic training
- Same validation set for all seeds

---

## Success Criteria

### C2 Ensemble
- [✅] All 5 seeds complete training
- [ ] Val loss variance < 5% CV
- [ ] Mean val loss < 0.30
- [ ] No seed divergence (early stop not at epoch 1-5)

### C1 Multi-Seed
- [ ] 3-5 seeds complete training
- [ ] Val loss variance < 3% CV
- [ ] Mean val loss < current (0.160418)
- [ ] Stable convergence

## What to Do When Training Completes

### 1. Analyze Results
```python
import torch
import numpy as np

seeds = [42, 123, 456, 789, 1337]
val_losses = []

for seed in seeds:
    ckpt = torch.load(f'checkpoints/c2_phase2_seed{seed}_ema_best.pt')
    val_losses.append(ckpt['val_loss'])
    print(f"Seed {seed}: {ckpt['val_loss']:.6f} (epoch {ckpt['epoch']})")

print(f"\nMean: {np.mean(val_losses):.6f}")
print(f"Std:  {np.std(val_losses):.6f}")
print(f"CV:   {100*np.std(val_losses)/np.mean(val_losses):.2f}%")
```

### 2. Create Ensemble Submission
- Load all 5 models
- Average predictions
- Add 3x TTA (time shift + noise)
- Fit linear calibrator on validation
- Test locally with random data

### 3. Quality Checks
- Verify no NaN/Inf in predictions
- Check prediction ranges (reasonable values)
- Validate checkpoint format (includes 'nrmse' and 'metrics')
- Test submission.py loads correctly

### 4. Submit
- Create clean zip with flat structure
- Include submission.py + 5 weight files
- Double-check before upload
