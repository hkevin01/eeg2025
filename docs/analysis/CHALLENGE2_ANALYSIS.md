# Challenge 2: Performance Analysis & Improvement Plan

## üìä Current Status

### Performance History
1. **Submission #1** (Initial)
   - Validation: 0.0808 NRMSE
   - Test: 1.1407 NRMSE
   - **Problem:** 14√ó degradation (severe overfitting)

2. **Submission #2** (Multi-release R1+R2)
   - Training: R1+R2 releases
   - Validation: 0.2970 NRMSE
   - **Improvement:** 1.1407 ‚Üí 0.2970 = 74% better! ‚úÖ

3. **Current Attempt** (R2+R3+R4)
   - Status: Training incomplete/crashed
   - Goal: Use more diverse data
   - Issue: Did not complete

### Key Findings

‚úÖ **What Worked:**
- Multi-release training drastically improved generalization
- R1+R2 combination reduced overfitting
- Compact architecture (64K params) is sufficient
- Strong regularization helps

‚ùå **Current Issues:**
1. R2+R3+R4 training crashed before completion
2. Current submission still uses R1+R2 weights (0.2970)
3. No attention mechanism for Challenge 2 (only Challenge 1 has it)
4. No cross-validation for Challenge 2
5. Limited data augmentation

## üéØ Performance Gap Analysis

### Challenge 1 vs Challenge 2
```
Challenge 1:
  - Architecture: CNN + Sparse Attention (846K params)
  - Training: 5-fold CV, data augmentation, AdamW
  - Validation: 0.2632 NRMSE
  - Strategy: Extensive regularization + attention

Challenge 2:
  - Architecture: Compact CNN (64K params)
  - Training: Single split, basic training, Adam
  - Validation: 0.2970 NRMSE
  - Strategy: Multi-release, basic regularization
```

**Gap:** Challenge 2 is ~13% worse than Challenge 1
- Could apply attention mechanism
- Could add cross-validation
- Could enhance data augmentation
- Could improve architecture

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did First Submission Overfit So Badly?
1. Trained on single release (R1 only)
2. Target variable has different distributions per release
3. Model memorized release-specific patterns
4. Did not generalize to other releases in test set

### Why Did R1+R2 Fix It?
1. Model sees multiple release distributions
2. Learns release-invariant features
3. Better generalization to unseen releases
4. Multi-release acts as implicit regularization

### Why Might R2+R3+R4 Be Even Better?
1. More diverse data (~40K samples vs ~25K)
2. Three different distribution patterns
3. Potentially better coverage of test set
4. Reduced risk of release-specific overfitting

## üìà Improvement Opportunities

### Short-term (Quick Wins)
1. ‚úÖ Complete R2+R3+R4 training
2. Add cross-validation (3-5 folds)
3. Implement data augmentation
4. Try ensemble of multiple models

### Medium-term (Significant Gains)
1. Add sparse attention to Challenge 2
2. Implement release-aware training
3. Try larger model (current is only 64K)
4. Hyperparameter optimization

### Long-term (Research Ideas)
1. Multi-task learning (C1 + C2 together)
2. Transfer learning from Challenge 1
3. Release prediction as auxiliary task
4. Meta-learning across releases

## üé≤ Expected Improvements

```
Current: 0.2970 NRMSE

With R2+R3+R4:           0.27-0.28 (-6-9%)
+ Cross-validation:      0.26-0.27 (-3-4%)
+ Data augmentation:     0.25-0.26 (-4-5%)
+ Sparse attention:      0.24-0.25 (-4-5%)
+ Ensemble (3 models):   0.23-0.24 (-4-5%)

Optimistic target: 0.23 NRMSE (23% improvement)
Conservative target: 0.26 NRMSE (13% improvement)
```
