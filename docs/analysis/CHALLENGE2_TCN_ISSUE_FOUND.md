# üîç Challenge 2 TCN Training Issue Discovered

**Date:** October 17, 2025, 23:58  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issue Found

---

## üêõ The Problem

The Challenge 2 training script (`scripts/train_challenge2_tcn.py`) has been training the **WRONG MODEL ARCHITECTURE** all along!

### What We Found

**Line 169-171 of train_challenge2_tcn.py:**
```python
model = TCN_EEG(
    num_channels=129,  # ‚ùå WRONG! This is Challenge 1's channel count
    num_outputs=1,     # ‚ùå WRONG! Challenge 2 needs 6 outputs
    ...
)
```

**What it SHOULD be:**
```python
model = TCN_EEG(
    num_channels=64,   # ‚úÖ Challenge 2: RestingState has 64 channels
    num_outputs=6,     # ‚úÖ Challenge 2: 6 externalizing features
    ...
)
```

### Impact

- ‚úÖ Training completed successfully (17 epochs, val loss 0.667792)
- ‚ùå But trained the WRONG model (Challenge 1 architecture)
- ‚ùå Model cannot be used for Challenge 2 submission
- ‚ùå Would fail on actual Challenge 2 data (dimension mismatch)

### Evidence

Checkpoint inspection shows:
- First layer: `torch.Size([48, 129, 7])` (expects 129 channels)
- FC layer: `torch.Size([1, 48])` (outputs 1 value)
- RestingState data: 64 channels, needs 6 outputs

**Mismatch confirmed!**

## ‚úÖ Solution: Use Existing CompactExternalizingCNN

### Decision

**Revert to the proven CompactExternalizingCNN model** for Challenge 2 in submission v6.

### Reasons

1. **Time Constraint:** Retraining would take 10-20 minutes
2. **Proven Performance:** CompactExternalizingCNN already validated (NRMSE 0.2917)
3. **Risk Mitigation:** Known working model vs untested TCN
4. **Submission Deadline:** Need to upload tonight

### Implementation

Keep the current submission.py as-is but:
- Revert Challenge 2 model back to CompactExternalizingCNN
- Use existing trained weights: `weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt`
- TCN can be implemented in submission v7 (future improvement)

---

## üìã Action Plan

### Immediate (Next 30 minutes)

1. **Revert submission.py** to use CompactExternalizingCNN for Challenge 2
2. **Keep TCN** for Challenge 1 (working perfectly)
3. **Test complete submission** with correct models
4. **Package submission v6** with:
   - Challenge 1: TCN (challenge1_tcn_competition_best.pth)
   - Challenge 2: CompactCNN (weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt)
5. **Upload to Codabench**

### Future (Submission v7)

1. **Fix train_challenge2_tcn.py:**
   - Change num_channels: 129 ‚Üí 64
   - Change num_outputs: 1 ‚Üí 6
   - Update model config accordingly

2. **Retrain Challenge 2 TCN** with correct architecture

3. **Integrate into submission v7** if performance improves

## üìä Current Status

### Submission v6 Plan (Revised)

- **Challenge 1:** ‚úÖ TCN (val loss 0.010170, 65% improvement)
- **Challenge 2:** ‚úÖ CompactCNN (val NRMSE 0.2917, baseline)
- **Overall:** Mixed architecture (TCN + CNN)
- **Status:** Ready to package and upload

### Todo List (Updated)

```markdown
## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] A1: Train Challenge 1 TCN
- [x] A2: Discover Challenge 2 training issue
- [x] A3: Create Memory Bank
- [x] Organize Documentation

## ‚è≥ Immediate Next Steps (30 min)
- [ ] A4: Revert Challenge 2 to CompactCNN in submission.py
- [ ] A5: Test Complete Submission
- [ ] A6: Package Submission v6
- [ ] A7: Upload to Codabench

## üîÆ Future (Submission v7)
- [ ] Fix Challenge 2 training script
- [ ] Retrain Challenge 2 TCN (correct architecture)
- [ ] Create submission v7 with dual-TCN
```

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Always validate model architecture** matches data dimensions
2. **Check checkpoints** before assuming training was correct
3. **Test inference** early to catch dimension mismatches
4. **Have fallback plans** (CompactCNN saves us here!)

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**The good news:**
- We caught this before submission!
- We have a working fallback (CompactCNN)
- Challenge 1 TCN is perfect and ready
- Can still submit v6 tonight

**Next steps:**
Revert to CompactCNN, test, package, and upload!

**Discovered:** October 17, 2025, 23:58  
**Resolution:** Use CompactCNN for Challenge 2 in v6  
**Future Fix:** Train correct Challenge 2 TCN for v7
