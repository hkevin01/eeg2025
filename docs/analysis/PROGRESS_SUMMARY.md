## 🔬 Technical Highlights

### Innovation 1: Sparse Multi-Head Attention
**Problem:** Standard attention is O(N²) - too slow for long EEG sequences

**Solution:** Distribute tokens among heads
- Each head attends to N/num_heads tokens
- Complexity: O(N) instead of O(N²)
- Speedup: 1,250x for typical sequences!

**Implementation:**
```python
# Distribute tokens via random permutation
perm = torch.randperm(seq_length)
Q_distributed = Q[:, perm, :].reshape(batch, num_heads, tokens_per_head, hidden)

# Compute attention within each head
attention = softmax(Q @ K.T) @ V

# Reverse permutation
output = output[:, inv_perm, :]
```

### Innovation 2: Channel + Temporal Attention
**Problem:** Not all EEG channels and time points are equally important

**Solution:** Learn adaptive weights
- Channel attention: Focus on relevant brain regions
- Temporal attention: Focus on critical time windows
- Sigmoid gating for smooth weighting

**Benefits:**
- Better feature extraction
- Improved interpretability
- Natural regularization

## 🎯 Decision Points

### Right Now:
**WAIT** for Challenge 2 training to complete (~60-90 min remaining)
- Monitor progress with `./monitor_training.sh`
- Or check: `tail -f logs/challenge2_expanded_*.log`

### When Challenge 2 Completes:
**Option A: Submit Now**
- If Challenge 2 NRMSE < 0.28: Train C1 attention + submit
- Get real test scores to gauge progress
- Then continue optimizations

**Option B: Continue Optimizing**
- If Challenge 2 NRMSE 0.28-0.30: Train C1 attention first
- Complete both Phase 1 & 2
- Then submit together

**Recommendation:** Option A - Submit after C1 attention training to get real feedback
