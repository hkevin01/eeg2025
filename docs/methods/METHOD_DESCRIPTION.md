## Innovation: Sparse Multi-Head Self-Attention (O(N) Complexity)

### The Problem with Traditional Attention
Traditional multi-head self-attention has O(N²) complexity, making it computationally prohibitive for long EEG sequences (200+ samples × 129 channels).

### Our Solution: Token Distribution
We developed a **sparse attention mechanism** that achieves O(N) complexity by:

1. **Distributing tokens among attention heads** instead of replicating
2. Each head processes only N/num_heads tokens
3. Random permutation ensures diverse interactions
4. Inverse permutation restores original order

**Complexity Reduction:**
- Traditional: O(N² × num_heads)
- Our method: O((N/num_heads)² × num_heads) = O(N²/num_heads)
- With num_heads = 0.5 × N: O(N) complexity
- **1,250× speedup** for typical sequences

## Task-Specific Advanced Methods (Future Exploration)

### Motivation
Different cognitive tasks elicit distinct neural signatures. While our current sparse attention CNN provides strong baseline performance, task-specific architectures could capture unique patterns more effectively.

### Proposed Methods by Task

#### **1. Resting State (RS)**
**Methods:** Spectral + Connectivity Analysis

**Key Components:**
- Power spectral density (PSD) features across frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma)
- Functional connectivity estimation (coherence, phase-locking value)
- Graph neural networks for brain network topology
- Multivariate autoregressive models for directed connectivity

**Rationale:** Resting-state EEG is characterized by rich oscillatory dynamics and functional network organization. Frequency-domain and connectivity features capture intrinsic brain states better than raw temporal features.

**Implementation Considerations:**
```python
class RestingStateNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # Multi-taper spectral estimation
        self.spectral_encoder = WaveletTransform(bands=FREQUENCY_BANDS)
        # Functional connectivity
        self.connectivity = CoherenceEstimator(num_channels=129)
        # Graph convolutional network
        self.gnn = GraphConvolution(adj_matrix='dynamic')
```

#### **2. Surround Suppression (SuS)**
**Methods:** Convolutional Layers + Attention Mechanisms

**Key Components:**
- Spatial convolutions mimicking retinotopic mapping
- Center-surround attention mechanisms
- Multi-scale receptive fields for different visual field sizes
- Visual cortex-inspired hierarchical processing

**Rationale:** Visual suppression effects require modeling spatial context and center-surround interactions, similar to V1 receptive field properties.

#### **3. Movie Watching (MW)**
**Methods:** Temporal Transformers + Dynamic Connectivity

**Key Components:**
- Temporal transformers for long-range dependencies (movie clips span minutes)
- Sliding-window dynamic connectivity analysis
- Time-varying graph neural networks
- Attention mechanisms for salient movie moments

**Rationale:** Movie watching induces complex temporal dynamics requiring models that capture long-range dependencies and time-varying network reconfigurations.

#### **4. Contrast Change Detection (CCD)**
**Methods:** ERP Extraction + Motor Preparation Modeling

**Key Components:**
- Event-related potential (ERP) template matching
- Motor cortex (central electrodes) feature extraction
- Pre-response time window analysis (-500ms to 0ms)
- Decision-related negativity and readiness potential features

**Rationale:** Detection tasks produce stereotyped ERPs (P300, N200) and motor preparation signals. Extracting these well-characterized components provides interpretable features.

**Current Status:** This is our strongest task (NRMSE 0.26) - already capturing some ERP features implicitly.

#### **5. Symbol Search (SyS)**
**Methods:** Spatial Attention Modeling

**Key Components:**
- Visual search attention maps over electrode space
- Parietal cortex (P3, P4, Pz) feature emphasis
- Working memory load indicators
- Eye movement-related potentials

**Rationale:** Symbol search engages visual attention networks (parietal cortex) and working memory systems (frontal-parietal networks).

### Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority:** CCD (our current best task) - optimize further
2. **Medium Priority:** RS (common task, well-studied features)
3. **Low Priority:** MW, SuS, SyS (less common, more experimental)

### Why Not Implemented Yet

1. **Strong Baseline Performance:** Current sparse attention CNN already achieves 0.26 NRMSE
2. **Computational Cost:** Task-specific models require separate training and hyperparameter tuning
3. **Competition Timeline:** Prioritizing robust general-purpose solution over task-specific tuning
4. **Overfitting Risk:** Task-specific architectures may overfit to limited training data

### Expected Improvements

If implemented, we estimate:
- **10-15% improvement** per task from specialized architectures
- **Overall score:** 0.23-0.25 NRMSE (vs current 0.26)
- **Trade-off:** Increased model complexity and training time

## Limitations & Future Work

1. **Sparse Attention Randomness:** Random permutation introduces stochasticity; deterministic sparse patterns could be explored
2. **Single Model per Challenge:** Ensemble of diverse architectures could improve robustness
3. **Task-Specific Tuning:** Could implement specialized architectures for each cognitive task (see above)
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Limited by computational budget; Bayesian optimization could help
5. **Challenge 2 Data:** Could explore additional releases or transfer learning
