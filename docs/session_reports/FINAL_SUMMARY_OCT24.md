- **Log**: `logs/challenge1/training_improved_final_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- **Monitor**: `./monitor_c1_improved.sh`
- **Expected**: 2-4 hours to completion

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Event Extraction (Critical Fix) ✅
**Problem**: Original code looked for wrong event patterns
**Solution**: Updated to match actual BIDS event structure:
```python
# Find: contrastTrial_start (event_code='5')
# Match with: buttonPress (event_code='12' or '13')
# Calculate: RT = buttonPress_onset - trial_start_onset
# Filter: 0.1s < RT < 5.0s, must have feedback
```

### Model Initialization ✅
**Problem**: `add_log_softmax` parameter not supported
**Solution**: Removed unsupported parameter

---

## 📊 Current Status

### Challenge 1: TRAINING 🔄
- Model: EEGNeX (~62K params)
- Data: 2,693 response time windows
- Status: Loading complete, training in progress
- Expected: Better than Oct 17 TCN results

### Challenge 2: COMPLETE ✅  
- Model: EEGNeX (~62K params)
- NRMSE: 0.0918 (5.4x better than target)
- Status: Ready for submission

---

## 🎉 Key Achievements

1. **Data Successfully Loaded**: 2,693 windows from Contrast Change Detection task
2. **Event Parsing Fixed**: Correct response time extraction from BIDS events
3. **Repository Organized**: Professional structure with organized logs
4. **Consistent Architecture**: Both challenges use EEGNeX with same anti-overfitting strategy
5. **Training Active**: Challenge 1 improved training running successfully

---

## 📁 Anti-Overfitting Strategy (Both Challenges)

### Data Augmentation
1. Random cropping (4s → 2s windows)
2. Amplitude scaling (±20%)
3. Channel dropout (20% prob, 5% channels)
4. Gaussian noise (σ=0.02)

### Regularization
1. Weight decay (1e-4)
2. Gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0)
3. Dropout in architecture

### Training Strategy
1. Early stopping (patience=15)
2. Dual LR schedulers (Cosine + Plateau)
3. Mixed precision (FP16)
4. Top-5 checkpoints

---

## 📈 Expected Results

### Challenge 1 (October 17 Baseline)
- Model: TCN (196K parameters)
- Val Loss: 0.010170
- No augmentation

### Challenge 1 (Improved - Training Now)
- Model: EEGNeX (62K parameters)
- Expected: Better generalization
- Augmentation: 4 types
- Expected NRMSE: Competitive or better

### Why Improvement Expected:
1. ✅ More efficient model (62K vs 196K params)
2. ✅ Strong data augmentation (prevents overfitting)
3. ✅ Better regularization (weight decay + clipping)
4. ✅ Dual LR schedulers (better convergence)
5. ✅ Same proven strategy that achieved 5.4x target on C2
