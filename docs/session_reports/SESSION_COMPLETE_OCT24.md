## 📊 Current Project Status

### Challenge 1: IN TRAINING 🔄
- **Model**: EEGNeX (improved)
- **Status**: Training in progress
- **Old Weights**: October 17 (TCN, 196K params)
- **New Weights**: Training now (EEGNeX, 62K params + augmentation)
- **Expected**: Better generalization and lower overfitting

### Challenge 2: COMPLETE ✅
- **Model**: EEGNeX
- **NRMSE**: 0.0918 (5.4x better than target)
- **Weights**: `weights_challenge_2.pt`
- **Status**: Ready for submission

---

## 🎯 Anti-Overfitting Strategy Applied

Both challenges now use the same proven strategy:

### 1. Data Augmentation
- ✅ Random cropping (4s → 2s)
- ✅ Amplitude scaling (±20%)
- ✅ Channel dropout (20% prob, 5% channels)
- ✅ Gaussian noise (σ=0.02)

### 2. Regularization
- ✅ Weight decay (1e-4)
- ✅ Gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0)
- ✅ Dropout in architecture

### 3. Training Strategy
- ✅ Early stopping (patience=15)
- ✅ Dual LR schedulers
- ✅ Mixed precision (FP16)
- ✅ Top-5 checkpoints

### 4. Monitoring
- ✅ NRMSE (primary)
- ✅ MAE
- ✅ Pearson correlation
- ✅ Train/val gap tracking

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (During Training)
1. ⏳ Monitor Challenge 1 training progress
   ```bash
   ./monitor_c1_improved.sh
   # or
   tail -f logs/challenge1/training_improved_*.log
   ```

2. ⏳ Wait for training completion (~2-4 hours)
   - Watch for convergence
   - Monitor NRMSE improvements
   - Check for early stopping

### After Training Complete
1. ⬜ Verify Challenge 1 weights created
2. ⬜ Compare new vs old Challenge 1 performance
3. ⬜ Test submission.py with new weights
4. ⬜ Create submission package
5. ⬜ Upload to Codabench
6. ⬜ Prepare 2-page methods document

### Repository Maintenance
1. ⬜ Git commit all changes
2. ⬜ Tag release (v1.0-improved)
3. ⬜ Update README with final results
4. ⬜ Archive old training scripts

## 📊 Key Improvements Over October 17

| Aspect | October 17 | October 24 (Improved) |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Model** | TCN (196K params) | EEGNeX (62K params) |
| **Augmentation** | None | 4 types |
| **Regularization** | Basic | Strong (weight decay + clipping) |
| **LR Scheduler** | Single | Dual (Cosine + Plateau) |
| **Precision** | FP32 | Mixed (FP16) |
