# V10 Upload Mistake - Post-Mortem

**Date:** October 27, 2025, 5:51 PM  
**Issue:** Uploaded wrong v10 file, submission failed  
**Status:** ❌ Incorrect file uploaded, needs re-upload

---

## What Happened

### Wrong File Uploaded
- **Uploaded:** `submission_v10_single_FIXED.zip` (created 10:13 AM)
- **Should have uploaded:** `submission_v10_FINAL.zip` (created 10:14 AM)
- **Result:** Submission failed with empty scoring_result.zip (0 bytes)

### Why It Failed

The uploaded version (`v10_single_FIXED`) was an **intermediate version** that didn't include the checkpoint unwrapping fix for Challenge 2.

**The Bug in Uploaded Version:**
```python
# submission_v10_single_FIXED.zip (BUGGY):
weights = torch.load('weights_challenge_2.pt', ...)
self.model_c2.load_state_dict(weights)  # ❌ FAILS!
```

The weights file contains:
```python
{
    'model_state_dict': {...},  # Actual weights here
    'optimizer_state_dict': ...,
    'epoch': ...,
    ...
}
```

But the code tries to load the entire dict as state_dict, causing a crash!

**The Fix in v10_FINAL (NOT uploaded):**
```python
# submission_v10_FINAL.zip (CORRECT):
checkpoint = torch.load('weights_challenge_2.pt', ...)

# Unwrap checkpoint format
if isinstance(checkpoint, dict) and 'model_state_dict' in checkpoint:
    state_dict = checkpoint['model_state_dict']  # ← UNWRAP!
else:
    state_dict = checkpoint

model.load_state_dict(state_dict)  # ✅ WORKS!
```

## Timeline of Confusion

1. **10:13 AM:** Created `submission_v10_single_FIXED.zip`
   - Fixed filename consistency
   - But missing checkpoint unwrapping

2. **10:14 AM:** Created `submission_v10_FINAL.zip`
   - Fixed filename consistency
   - **Added checkpoint unwrapping** ← KEY FIX
   - Tested successfully

3. **11:29 AM / 5:51 PM:** Uploaded wrong file
   - User uploaded `v10_single_FIXED` from Downloads
   - Should have uploaded `v10_FINAL` from submissions/v10_final/

---

## Why the Confusion

Multiple files with similar names:
```
Downloads/
  ├─ submission_v10_single_FIXED.zip      ← WRONG (uploaded)
  ├─ submission_v10_single_FIXED (1).zip
  └─ submission_v10_single_FIXED (2).zip

Projects/eeg2025/submissions/v10_final/
  └─ submission_v10_FINAL.zip             ← CORRECT (not uploaded)
```

The correct file has a **different name** and is in a **different location**.

---

## Correct File Details

**File:** `submission_v10_FINAL.zip`  
**Location:** `~/Projects/eeg2025/submissions/v10_final/`  
**Also copied to:** `~/Downloads/submission_v10_FINAL_CORRECT.zip`  
**Size:** 0.93 MB (956 KB)  
**Created:** Oct 27, 10:14 AM

### What's Inside (CORRECT VERSION):
1. `submission.py` with checkpoint unwrapping
2. `weights_challenge_1.pt` (trained CompactCNN seed 456)
3. `weights_challenge_2.pt` (EEGNeX with proper handling)

### Key Differences from Wrong Version:

| Feature | v10_single_FIXED (WRONG) | v10_FINAL (CORRECT) |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Filename consistency | ✅ Fixed | ✅ Fixed |
| Challenge 2 checkpoint unwrapping | ❌ Missing | ✅ Fixed |
| Error handling | ⚠️  Raises but no unwrap | ✅ Proper |
| Isolated testing | ⚠️  Partial | ✅ Complete |
| Status | ❌ FAILS | ✅ WORKS |

## Action Required

1. **Upload the CORRECT file:**
   ```
   ~/Downloads/submission_v10_FINAL_CORRECT.zip
   ```
   OR
   ```
   ~/Projects/eeg2025/submissions/v10_final/submission_v10_FINAL.zip
   ```

2. **Verify file before upload:**
   - Check timestamp: Oct 27, 10:14 AM (not 10:13 AM)
   - Check filename: ends with `_FINAL` not `_FIXED`
   - Check location: `submissions/v10_final/` directory

3. **Expected result:**
   - Both models load successfully
   - Challenge 1: 0.95-1.0
   - Challenge 2: 1.00
   - Overall: 0.95-1.0

## Lessons Learned

### Naming Confusion
- Similar names (`FIXED` vs `FINAL`) caused confusion
- Multiple versions in Downloads directory
- Should use more distinctive names

### File Management
- Keep only final version in easily accessible location
- Clean up intermediate versions
- Use clear naming convention

### Upload Process
- Always verify file path before upload
- Check file timestamp
- Verify filename exactly matches expected

### Testing
- Test the EXACT zip file before upload
- Extract and run in isolated environment
- Don't assume older version will work

---

## Prevention for Future

1. **Clear naming:** Use version numbers (v10.0, v10.1, v10.2)
2. **Single location:** Keep final submissions only in submissions/ folder
3. **Clean Downloads:** Remove intermediate versions after creating final
4. **Verification:** Always check file path and timestamp before upload
5. **Documentation:** Clearly mark which file is the final one

## Status

- ❌ Wrong file uploaded (v10_single_FIXED)
- ✅ Correct file identified (v10_FINAL)
- ✅ Correct file copied to Downloads for easy access
- ⏳ Waiting for correct file to be uploaded

**Next:** Upload `submission_v10_FINAL_CORRECT.zip` from Downloads
