# ROCm GPU Compatibility Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-14  
**GPU**: AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT  
**Architecture**: Navi 10 (gfx1010)  
**Current ROCm**: 6.2  
**Latest ROCm**: 7.0.2

---

## Critical Finding: RX 5700 XT is NOT Officially Supported

### Supported RDNA GPUs in ROCm 7.0.2
- ‚úÖ **RDNA2** (gfx1030): Radeon PRO W6800, V620  
- ‚úÖ **RDNA3** (gfx1100-gfx1201): RX 7000 series, PRO W7000 series  
- ‚ùå **RDNA1 (Navi 10, gfx1010)**: **NOT SUPPORTED**

### Why RX 5700 XT Crashes
1. **Not in supported GPU list**: AMD officially discontinued Navi 10 support in newer ROCm versions
2. **Driver incompatibility**: ROCm 6.2+ focuses on RDNA2+ and CDNA architectures
3. **Missing optimizations**: hipBLASLt, CK (Composable Kernel), and other libraries lack Navi 10 kernels
4. **Unstable workarounds**: `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` hack causes unpredictable behavior

## ROCm Version History for Navi 10

| ROCm Version | Navi 10 Support | Notes |
|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| ROCm 3.x-4.x | ‚úÖ Experimental | Best support for RX 5700 XT |
| ROCm 5.0-5.7 | üü° Limited | Unstable, many crashes |
| ROCm 6.0+ | ‚ùå Dropped | Focus on RDNA2+, CDNA |
| ROCm 7.0+ | ‚ùå No support | Not in compatibility matrix |

## Recent CUDA/ROCm Developments (2025)

### What's New in ROCm 7.0 (September 2025)
- **FlashAttention v3** integrated for AMD GPUs
- **PyTorch 2.7/2.8** support with ROCm backend
- **Enhanced Triton Integration** (AOTriton 0.10b)
- **Better RDNA3 support** (gfx1100, gfx1101, gfx1200, gfx1201)
- **CDNA4 support** (MI355X, MI350X)

### CUDA Compatibility Layer
- **HIP (Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability)** - Allows CUDA code to run on AMD GPUs
- **HIPIFY** - Converts CUDA code to HIP automatically
- **NOT a direct CUDA runtime**: HIP is a translation layer, not native CUDA

### No "CUDA on ROCm" for Consumer GPUs
The recent developments you mentioned are likely:
1. **Enterprise GPUs only**: CUDA-HIP translation improvements for MI300X/MI250X
2. **PyTorch improvements**: Better `torch.cuda` API compatibility (naming only)
3. **Docker container improvements**: Easier CUDA-to-HIP porting workflows

---

## Why Your GPU Still Won't Work Reliably

Even with the latest developments:
1. **RX 5700 XT is not in the compatibility matrix** - AMD dropped support
2. **Consumer RDNA1 never had full ROCm support** - Always experimental
3. **System crashes are expected** - No stable driver for this GPU + PyTorch combo
4. **Workarounds cause instability** - `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` breaks driver assumptions

---

## Solutions Ranked by Feasibility

### 1. Continue with CPU Training ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (RECOMMENDED)
**Status**: Working perfectly  
**Pros**:
- Stable, no crashes
- Can complete P2 tasks
- Competition doesn't penalize training speed
- Model quality matters more than training time

**Cons**:
- Slower (10-20x)
- Limited to smaller batches

**Implementation**: Already done! Use `scripts/train_cpu_only.py`

---

### 2. Downgrade to ROCm 4.x ‚≠ê‚≠ê (NOT RECOMMENDED)
**Status**: Possible but risky  
**Effort**: High  
**Risk**: Very high (may break system)

**Steps**:
```bash
# Remove ROCm 6.2
sudo apt remove rocm-hip-sdk rocm-libs -y
sudo apt autoremove -y

# Install ROCm 4.5 (last stable version for Navi 10)
wget https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/4.5/
# ... complex installation ...

# Install old PyTorch for ROCm 4.5
pip3 uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
pip3 install torch==1.10.0+rocm4.5 torchvision torchaudio \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm4.5
```

**Problems**:
- Old PyTorch (1.10.0, from 2021)
- Missing features we're using
- May not support modern Python
- Will break other dependencies

---

### 3. Cloud GPU Training ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (VIABLE ALTERNATIVE)
**Status**: Available immediately  
**Cost**: $0.50-2/hour  
**Platforms**: Vast.ai, RunPod, Lambda Labs, Google Colab Pro

**Recommended**: Vast.ai (cheapest)
```bash
# 1. Create account at vast.ai
# 2. Search for GPU: RTX 3090 or RTX 4090
# 3. Price: ~$0.30-0.80/hour
# 4. Select Ubuntu + PyTorch template
# 5. Upload code and data
# 6. Train for 4-8 hours
# Total cost: $2-6 for full training
```

**Pros**:
- NVIDIA GPUs with mature CUDA support
- Fast (10-20x speedup)
- No system risk
- Pay only for what you use

**Cons**:
- Need to upload data (~5-10GB)
- Need to manage remote instance
- Internet dependency

---

### 4. Get NVIDIA GPU ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (IF BUDGET ALLOWS)
**Status**: Requires hardware purchase  
**Cost**: $300-800  
**Options**:
- RTX 3060 12GB: ~$300 (sufficient)
- RTX 3090 24GB: ~$800 (overkill)
- RTX 4070 12GB: ~$500 (good balance)

**Pros**:
- Stable CUDA support
- Works with all ML frameworks
- Resale value

**Cons**:
- Upfront cost
- Need to physically install
- Competition deadline may not allow time

---

### 5. Use AMD RDNA3 GPU ‚≠ê‚≠ê (FUTURE CONSIDERATION)
**Status**: Requires hardware purchase  
**Cost**: $400-900  
**Options**:

- RX 7900 XTX (gfx1100): ~$900 - ‚úÖ Supported in ROCm 7.0

**Pros**:
- Official ROCm 7.0 support
- Good performance
- 20GB+ VRAM

**Cons**:
- Expensive
- Still not as mature as NVIDIA CUDA
- May have different stability issues

## Detailed Analysis of "New CUDA/ROCm Developments"

### What Actually Changed in 2025

#### 1. HIP Improvements (Not CUDA Runtime)
- HIP API closer to CUDA API
- Better `torch.cuda.*` compatibility **in name only**
- Still requires AMD GPU with proper drivers

#### 2. Docker Container Improvements
- Easier to run CUDA code on AMD GPUs **via HIP translation**
- Pre-built containers with ROCm + PyTorch
- **Does NOT make RX 5700 XT suddenly work**

#### 3. Enterprise GPU Focus
- All improvements target MI300X, MI250X (CDNA)
- Consumer GPUs (RDNA) are afterthought
- RDNA1 (your GPU) completely dropped

#### 4. PyTorch Backend Improvements
- Better ROCm integration in PyTorch 2.7/2.8
- FlashAttention v3 for AMD
- Composable Kernel optimizations
- **All require RDNA2+ or CDNA GPUs**

## Technical Deep Dive: Why Workarounds Fail

### The `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` Hack
```bash
export HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0  # Pretend to be gfx1030
```

**What it does**: Tells ROCm driver "I'm gfx1030 (RDNA2)"  
**Why it partially works**: Driver loads basic kernels  
**Why it crashes**: 
1. Hardware doesn't match gfx1030 ISA (instruction set)
2. Missing hardware features (e.g., ray tracing units)
3. Memory layout differences
4. Cache hierarchy differences
5. Compute unit count mismatch

**Result**: Works for tiny operations, crashes on real workloads

---

## Recommendation: Pragmatic Path Forward

### Short-term (This Week)
1. ‚úÖ **Use CPU training** for P2 foundation model
2. ‚úÖ Implement Challenge 1 & 2 on CPU
3. ‚úÖ Focus on model architecture and features
4. ‚è±Ô∏è Run training overnight if needed

### Mid-term (If Needed)
1. **Evaluate results**: If CPU training produces good model, done!
2. **If more speed needed**: Use Vast.ai for $2-6 to train larger model
3. **Cloud GPU workflow**:
   - Train foundation model on RTX 3090 (4-8 hours)
   - Download trained weights
   - Run inference/evaluation locally on CPU

### Long-term (After Competition)
1. **If continuing ML work**: Consider NVIDIA GPU purchase
2. **If AMD loyal**: Wait for next-gen RDNA4 with better ROCm support
3. **Learn from experience**: Always check GPU compatibility before committing

## Conclusion

**Your RX 5700 XT cannot reliably train neural networks with current ROCm versions.**

The "new developments" in CUDA/ROCm you mentioned:
- ‚úÖ Real improvements in HIP/ROCm ecosystem
- ‚úÖ Better PyTorch integration
- ‚ùå Do NOT help Navi 10 (gfx1010) GPUs
- ‚ùå All improvements target RDNA2+, RDNA3, and CDNA

**Best path**: Accept CPU training as the solution. It works perfectly, and the competition evaluates model performance, not training speed. A well-architected model trained on CPU can beat a poorly designed model trained on the fastest GPU.

**Alternative**: Spend $3-6 on Vast.ai cloud GPU for final training run if needed.

**Not recommended**: Trying to fix RX 5700 XT ROCm issues - you'll waste days and likely fail.
