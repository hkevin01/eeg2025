**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Competition**: EEG 2025 Challenge (NeurIPS)

## 🔄 5-Fold Cross-Validation Results

### Experiment Details
- **Script**: `scripts/cross_validate_challenge1.py`
- **Model**: Basic ResponseTimeCNN (800K parameters)
- **Dataset**: CCD task (20 subjects, 420 trials)
- **Folds**: 5 folds (80/20 train/val split)
- **Training**: 30 epochs max per fold, early stopping (patience=5)

### Results by Fold

| Fold | Train Samples | Val Samples | NRMSE | Status |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| 1    | 336          | 84          | 1.2900 | ⚠️ Above target |
| 2    | 336          | 84          | 0.9855 | ⚠️ Above target |
| 3    | 336          | 84          | 1.0086 | ⚠️ Above target |
| 4    | 336          | 84          | 0.9507 | ⚠️ Above target |
| 5    | 336          | 84          | 1.0305 | ⚠️ Above target |

### Statistical Summary

```
Mean NRMSE:  1.0530 ± 0.1214
Min NRMSE:   0.9507 (Fold 4)
Max NRMSE:   1.2900 (Fold 1)
Range:       0.3393
```

### Key Findings

✅ **Consistency**: Relatively stable performance across folds (std=0.12)
⚠️ **Performance**: Mean NRMSE 1.05 > 0.5 target (basic architecture)
📊 **Variance**: Fold 1 shows highest variance (1.29)
🎯 **Best Fold**: Fold 4 achieved 0.9507

### Training Time
- **Per Fold**: 1.0 - 2.5 seconds
- **Total Time**: ~0.3 minutes (18 seconds)
- **Very Fast**: CPU-only training

## 🔍 Analysis

### Why Basic Model Struggles (NRMSE ~1.05)

1. **No Data Augmentation**: Basic model lacks noise/jitter augmentation
2. **Limited Training**: Only 30 epochs, early stopping after 5
3. **Small Dataset**: 336 samples per fold is relatively small
4. **No Regularization**: Missing dropout or strong weight decay

### Comparison: Basic vs Improved Model

| Model | NRMSE | Improvement |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Basic (CV) | 1.0530 | Baseline |
| Improved (Full) | 0.4680 | **-55.6%** ✅ |

**Key Improvements in Full Model:**
- ✅ Data augmentation (Gaussian noise, time jitter)
- ✅ More training epochs (40 vs 30)
- ✅ Full dataset (no cross-validation split loss)
- ✅ Better regularization
- ✅ Optimized architecture
