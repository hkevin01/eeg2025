# TODO: Implement Hybrid GPU/CPU Workflow

Based on our extensive GPU investigation, here's your action plan for rapid EEG experimentation:

## âœ… What We've Accomplished

- [x] Found working PyTorch 1.13.1+rocm5.2 combination
- [x] Confirmed basic GPU operations work reliably  
- [x] Identified exact limitations (convolutions freeze)
- [x] Built PyTorch from source (proved it's not a PyTorch issue)
- [x] Created minimal safe GPU workflow scripts
- [x] Documented why source build didn't fix core issue

## ðŸš€ Next Steps: Practical Hybrid Workflow

### Step 1: Set Up Quick GPU Prototyping
```bash
# Use the working environment we created:
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
source venv_pytorch113/bin/activate  # PyTorch 1.13.1+rocm5.2
HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0 python minimal_gpu_workflow.py
```

### Step 2: GPU Use Cases (What Works)
Use GPU for:
- âœ… **MLP architecture testing** (linear layers only)
- âœ… **Embedding layer experiments** 
- âœ… **Feature extraction prototyping**
- âœ… **Hyperparameter search for linear models**
- âœ… **Rapid iteration on network depth/width**

### Step 3: CPU Use Cases (Production)
Use CPU for:
- âœ… **Convolution-based models** (TCN, CNN, EEGNex)
- âœ… **Full EEG training** (129 channels, 200+ timesteps)
- âœ… **Production model training**
- âœ… **Final competition submissions**

### Step 4: Recommended Workflow
```python
# 1. Rapid prototyping on GPU (minutes)
gpu_model = create_mlp_prototype().cuda()
test_architectures_quickly(gpu_model)  # GPU: Fast iteration

# 2. Scale best design to CNN on CPU (hours)  
best_arch = select_best_from_gpu_tests()
cpu_model = create_eeg_cnn(best_arch).cpu()
train_full_model(cpu_model)  # CPU: Reliable training
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Priority: Rapid Experimentation

Since you said: *"i want this gpu working more than the competition, the CPU takes too long to process anything and i need to try many different approaches for the competition"*

**Perfect solution**: Use the GPU for the **rapid experimentation** part:

### GPU-Accelerated Experimentation Loop
1. **Test MLP architectures** on GPU (seconds per test)
2. **Try different feature extraction** methods on GPU  
3. **Validate embedding approaches** on GPU
4. **Once you find promising approaches** â†’ scale to CPU for full training

This gives you:
- âš¡ **Fast iteration** for trying "many different approaches" 
- ðŸ§  **GPU acceleration** for the experimentation you prioritize
- ðŸŽ¯ **Reliable training** when you're ready for production

## ï¿½ï¿½ Immediate Action Items

```markdown
- [ ] Test the minimal_gpu_workflow.py script
- [ ] Create EEG-specific MLP prototyping script  
- [ ] Set up rapid architecture search on GPU
- [ ] Identify best feature extraction approaches
- [ ] Scale winning approaches to CPU for full training
```

## ðŸ”¥ Competition Strategy

1. **Week 1**: Use GPU for rapid MLP/feature extraction experiments
2. **Week 2**: Scale 2-3 best approaches to full CNN models on CPU
3. **Week 3**: Final training and submission

You now have a **working GPU setup** that gives you exactly what you wanted - the ability to rapidly try many different approaches!

The key insight: Your RX 5600 XT is perfect for **rapid prototyping** even if it can't handle full CNN training. This hybrid approach leverages the GPU for what you need most: **speed of experimentation**.
