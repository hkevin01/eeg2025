# GPU Solution - Final Analysis

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** PyTorch Incompatibility Confirmed

## Root Cause

**PyTorch 2.5.1+rocm6.2 was NOT compiled with gfx1010 support!**

Compiled for: gfx900, gfx906, gfx908, gfx90a, gfx1030, gfx1100, gfx942
Missing: gfx1010 (your RX 5600 XT)

## The Catch-22

- Remove HSA_OVERRIDE → GPU detected as gfx1010 → No PyTorch kernels → "invalid device function"
- Keep HSA_OVERRIDE → GPU pretends to be gfx1030 → Wrong kernels → Memory aperture violation

## RECOMMENDED SOLUTION FOR COMPETITION

**USE CPU TRAINING** - It's reliable and fast enough!

```bash
python3 scripts/training/train_challenge2_fast.py
# Auto-detects and uses CPU
# ~2-3 hours total training time
```

## After Competition

Try adding to ~/.bashrc:
```bash
export AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL=3
```

Or compile PyTorch with gfx1010:
```bash
export PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH="gfx1010"
pip install torch --no-binary torch
```

## Bottom Line

- Your GPU hardware is fine
- PyTorch just wasn't built for it  
- CPU training works perfectly
- Meet the deadline first, optimize later

**Keep HSA_OVERRIDE commented out, use CPU training.**
