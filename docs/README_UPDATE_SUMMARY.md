## 💡 Key Messages in Updated README

### What We Want Readers to Know
1. **We're ready:** Models trained, validated, packaged
2. **We're thorough:** Cross-validation, ensemble, testing
3. **We're innovative:** Data augmentation for small datasets
4. **We're realistic:** Unknown competitive position until leaderboard
5. **We're prepared:** 18 days to iterate based on feedback

### What We Corrected
- ❌ Removed "outperforming baseline of 0.5" (no such baseline exists)
- ✅ Added proper NRMSE interpretation
- ✅ Set realistic competitive expectations
- ✅ Clarified validation vs test performance
