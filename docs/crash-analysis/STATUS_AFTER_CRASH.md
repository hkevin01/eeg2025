## 🔍 Crash Summary

## 📊 Current Project Status

Let me check what survived the crash...

## Current Status (Checked at 5:55 PM)

### Cache Files
- ✅ challenge2_R1_windows.h5: 11GB (COMPLETE)
- ✅ challenge2_R2_windows.h5: 12GB (COMPLETE)
- ❌ challenge2_R3_windows.h5: Missing
- ❌ challenge2_R4_windows.h5: Missing
- ❌ challenge2_R5_windows.h5: Missing

**Total Cached:** 23GB / ~50GB expected

### Running Processes
- ❌ No cache creation processes running
- ❌ No training processes running
- ❌ No tmux sessions active

**All processes died with VS Code crash**

### What Survived
✅ Cache files R1, R2 (23GB preserved)
✅ Database: data/metadata.db (56KB)
✅ Training scripts: All present
✅ Documentation: All present

### What Was Lost
❌ R3, R4, R5 cache creation (was in progress)
❌ Any terminal processes
❌ tmux sessions (if any were running)

---

## 🚀 Recovery Actions Needed

### 1. Fix VS Code Settings ✅ DONE
Created `.vscode/settings.json` with:
- File watcher exclusions (logs, data, cache)
- Search exclusions
- Large file handling
- Terminal persistence disabled

### 2. Restart Cache Creation for R3, R4, R5
Need to run in tmux (crash-resistant):
```bash
tmux new -s cache_remaining "python3 create_challenge2_cache_remaining.py"
```

### 3. After Cache Completes
```bash
tmux new -s training "python3 train_challenge2_fast.py"
```

## 📋 Updated Todo List

```markdown
- [x] Analyze VS Code crash logs
- [x] Create crash analysis report (VSCODE_CRASH_ANALYSIS.md)
- [x] Fix VS Code settings to prevent future crashes
- [x] Verify existing cache files (R1, R2)
- [ ] Create R3, R4, R5 cache files in tmux
- [ ] Start training in tmux
- [ ] Monitor training via database
- [ ] Complete Challenge 2 training
- [ ] Submit before Nov 2 deadline (13 days)
```

## 📁 Files for VS Code Team

### Crash Logs
- `~/.config/Code/logs/20251019T174530/main.log`
- `VSCODE_CRASH_ANALYSIS.md` (this repo)

### Trigger Files
- `logs/cache_creation.log` (22MB - likely crash trigger)
- Large cache files in workspace

### Recommendations Implemented
✅ File watcher exclusions
✅ tmux for long-running processes
✅ Search exclusions for large directories

## Next Immediate Action

**Run this command to restart cache creation:**
```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025 && \
tmux new -s cache_remaining -d "python3 create_challenge2_cache_remaining.py 2>&1 | tee logs/cache_R3_R4_R5_recovery.log" && \
echo "✅ Cache creation restarted in tmux session 'cache_remaining'" && \
echo "Monitor with: tmux attach -t cache_remaining"
```
