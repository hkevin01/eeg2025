## ✅ Actions Completed

### 1. Crash Analysis ✅
- Extracted and analyzed VS Code logs
- Identified RegExp.test() as root cause
- Documented cascading failure sequence
- Created recommendations for VS Code team

### 2. Crash Prevention ✅
`.vscode/settings.json` created with:
- File watcher exclusions (logs/, data/, cache/, archive/)
- Search exclusions for large directories
- Large file memory limit (4GB)
- Terminal persistence disabled

### 3. Data Recovery ✅
- R1 cache: 11GB preserved ✅
- R2 cache: 12GB preserved ✅
- Database: metadata.db preserved ✅
- All scripts and checkpoints intact ✅

### 4. Process Restoration ✅
- Created R3, R4, R5 cache creation script
- Started in tmux (crash-resistant)
- Process running: `tmux attach -t cache_remaining`
- Log: `logs/cache_R3_R4_R5_recovery.log`

## 🔄 Current Status

### Cache Files
```
✅ challenge2_R1_windows.h5   11GB  (COMPLETE)
✅ challenge2_R2_windows.h5   12GB  (COMPLETE)
🔄 challenge2_R3_windows.h5         (Creating in tmux...)
⏳ challenge2_R4_windows.h5         (Pending)
⏳ challenge2_R5_windows.h5         (Pending)
```

### Running Processes
```
🔄 tmux session: cache_remaining
📝 Log file: logs/cache_R3_R4_R5_recovery.log
⏱️  Estimated time: 30-60 minutes
```

## 🚀 Monitoring & Next Steps

### Check Progress
```bash
# List tmux sessions
tmux ls

# Attach to watch live (Ctrl+B D to detach)
tmux attach -t cache_remaining

# Check log
tail -f logs/cache_R3_R4_R5_recovery.log

# Check cache files
ls -lh data/cached/challenge2_*.h5
```

### After Cache Completes
```bash
# Verify all files created
ls -lh data/cached/challenge2_*.h5

# Start training in tmux
tmux new -s training "python3 train_challenge2_fast.py 2>&1 | tee logs/training_fast.log"

# Monitor training
sqlite3 data/metadata.db 'SELECT * FROM training_runs;'
sqlite3 data/metadata.db 'SELECT * FROM epoch_history WHERE run_id=1;'
```

## 📊 Project Timeline

- **Today:** Cache R3, R4, R5 (~30-60 min)
- **Tonight:** Start training in tmux
- **This Week:** Complete Challenge 2 training (5-10 epochs)
- **Before Nov 2:** Test, organize, submit (13 days remaining)

## 🔍 Root Cause Details

### What Crashed
**Primary:** RegExp.test() froze UI thread (2+ seconds)  
**Trigger:** Processing 22MB `logs/cache_creation.log`  
**Cascade:** Extension Host → ptyHost → File Watchers → All Processes  
**Signal:** SIGTERM (code 15) - forced termination

### Why It Happened
1. Large log file (22MB) in watched directory
2. No timeout on RegExp operations
3. File watchers active on logs/ and data/
4. High memory usage (22GB cache process)
5. Multiple terminal processes competing

### Why It Won't Happen Again
✅ File watchers excluded logs/ and data/  
✅ Search excluded large directories  
✅ Critical processes in tmux (survive crashes)  
✅ Large file limit increased

## 📧 For VS Code GitHub Issue

**Title:** VS Code Complete Crash - RegExp Freeze Triggers Cascading Process Failure

**Summary:** RegExp.test() operation with no timeout froze UI thread while processing 
large log file (22MB), triggering complete instance crash with all processes killed 
via SIGTERM (code 15).

**Logs:** See `~/.config/Code/logs/20251019T174530/main.log`

**Analysis:** See attached `VSCODE_CRASH_ANALYSIS.md`

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement timeout for RegExp operations
2. Allow terminal survival during crashes  
3. Warn on large files (>10MB) in watched directories
4. Graceful degradation (don't kill all processes)
5. Save/restore terminal state

**Workaround:** File watcher exclusions + tmux for critical processes
