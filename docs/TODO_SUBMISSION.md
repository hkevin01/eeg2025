## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### Priority 1: Pre-Submission Testing (TODAY)

- [ ] **Test submission.py locally**
  ```bash
  cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
  python submission.py
  ```
  - Verify Challenge 1 model loads correctly
  - Verify Challenge 2 model loads correctly
  - Check output format

- [ ] **Test with sample data**
  ```bash
  # Create a small test dataset
  # Run submission.py on test data
  # Validate predictions format
  ```

- [ ] **Verify submission package structure**
  - Check all required files are included
  - Verify weights files are packaged
  - Confirm package size is acceptable

### Priority 2: Codabench Submission (NEXT)

- [ ] **Create submission package**
  ```bash
  cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
  bash prepare_submission.sh
  # or
  python submission.py --create-package
  ```

- [ ] **Upload to Codabench**
  - Navigate to: https://www.codabench.org/competitions/9975/
  - Upload submission_package.zip
  - Wait for evaluation
  - Check results

- [ ] **Monitor submission status**
  - Check for any errors
  - Review evaluation metrics
  - Compare with local validation results

### Priority 3: Documentation (PARALLEL)

- [ ] **Prepare methods document (2 pages)**
  - Model architectures (TCN + EEGNeX)
  - Data preprocessing steps
  - Training procedures
  - Anti-overfitting measures
  - Performance results
  - Key design decisions

- [ ] **Update README.md**
  - Add final competition results
  - Include Codabench submission link
  - Update status badges

- [ ] **Clean up temporary files**
  ```bash
  # Remove temporary training scripts
  rm -f train_challenge1_*.py
  rm -f training_*.log
  rm -f check_*.sh monitor_*.sh
  ```

### Priority 4: Final Repository Cleanup (AFTER SUBMISSION)

- [ ] **Git commit and push**
  ```bash
  git add .gitignore GITIGNORE_UPDATE_COMPLETE.md READY_FOR_SUBMISSION.md TODO_SUBMISSION.md
  git commit -m "chore: Update .gitignore and add submission documentation"
  git push
  ```

- [ ] **Archive old files**
  - Move temporary scripts to archive/
  - Move old status reports to archive/status_reports/
  - Keep only essential files in root

- [ ] **Tag release**
  ```bash
  git tag -a v1.0-submission -m "EEG2025 Competition Submission - Both Challenges Complete"
  git push origin v1.0-submission
  ```
