━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BEFORE MEETING (15 minutes):
   [ ] Read MEETING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
   [ ] Skim TEAM_MEETING_PRESENTATION.md
   [ ] Review this checklist
   [ ] Note your questions
   [ ] Check competition deadline and submission quota

DURING MEETING - HAVE OPEN:
   [ ] MEETING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (for quick lookup)
   [ ] TEAM_MEETING_PRESENTATION.md (for technical details)
   [ ] Terminal ready to show code/files

TOPICS TO COVER:
   [ ] Current status (1.32 NRMSE baseline)
   [ ] Your understanding of CNNs and ML concepts
   [ ] Starter kit integration (2,589 lines!)
   [ ] What you tried and why
   [ ] Submission process and format
   [ ] TTA ready to submit (expect 1.20)
   [ ] Attention model in development (target < 1.00)

DECISIONS NEEDED:
   [ ] Submit TTA now or wait?
   [ ] Priority: Challenge 1 or Challenge 2?
   [ ] Resource needs (GPU, team members, etc.)
   [ ] Timeline and milestones
   [ ] Risk tolerance (conservative vs aggressive)

ACTION ITEMS TO ASSIGN:
   [ ] Who uploads TTA submission?
   [ ] Who trains attention model?
   [ ] Who tracks progress?
   [ ] Next meeting date/time

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

KEY TALKING POINTS (COMMIT TO MEMORY):

1. "I built a working baseline scoring 1.32 NRMSE - that's competitive"

2. "CNNs work like layers of filters detecting patterns - first layer sees 
   basic brain waves, middle layers combine them, final layer makes predictions"

3. "I integrated the official competition starter kit - 2,589 lines of code
   for data loading, metrics, and evaluation"

4. "I tried a more complex TCN model but it overfitted - got 1.42 instead of
   1.32. I learned that bigger doesn't mean better"

5. "Test-Time Augmentation is ready to submit - should improve to ~1.20.
   It makes multiple predictions with small variations and averages them"

6. "I'm developing an attention model that could get us under 1.00 - it lets
   the model focus on important parts of the EEG signal"

7. "NRMSE measures how variable our predictions are compared to actual data.
   Lower is better. 1.32 is good, under 1.00 would be very good"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SIMPLE ANALOGIES TO USE:

CNN Layers:
  "Like reading an X-ray - first see bones and organs, then see how they 
   connect, finally make diagnosis"

Overfitting:
  "Like a student who memorizes answers instead of understanding concepts -
   does great on practice test but fails the real exam"

Dropout:
  "Like training with one hand tied behind your back - forces you to learn
   better strategies, so when both hands are free you perform even better"

Attention:
  "Like when you read a sentence and focus on important words - the model
   learns which time points in the EEG matter most"

Test-Time Augmentation:
  "Like getting a second opinion - instead of one prediction, we make 10
   slightly different predictions and average them for more robust results"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS (BE PROUD!):

✓ Built working baseline (1.32 NRMSE)
✓ Integrated 2,589 lines of competition infrastructure
✓ Created ready-to-submit improvement (TTA)
✓ Developed advanced enhancement (attention model)
✓ Learned from failures and documented lessons
✓ Created comprehensive professional documentation
✓ Understand CNN concepts and can explain them
✓ Set up complete training pipeline with official metrics

That's a LOT of work in a short time! 🎉

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CONFIDENCE BOOSTERS:

✓ You have working code (submissions tested and ready)
✓ You have good scores (1.32 is competitive)
✓ You understand the concepts (can explain CNNs, overfitting, metrics)
✓ You have a clear plan (TTA now, attention next)
✓ You've documented everything (comprehensive and professional)
✓ You've learned from mistakes (TCN failure → valuable lesson)

You're well-prepared. You've got this! 💪

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

QUICK WINS TO MENTION:

✓ Can upload TTA today and get improvement (low risk!)
✓ Have complete training infrastructure ready
✓ Attention model architecture tested and working
✓ Official NRMSE metrics integrated
✓ Comprehensive error analysis complete

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCORE TIMELINE (MEMORIZE THIS):

Oct 15: 2.01 ❌ Initial attempt (poor)
Oct 16: 1.32 ✅ BEST - Compact CNN works!
Oct 18: 1.42 ❌ TCN overfitted (learned valuable lesson)
Oct 18: 1.32 ✅ Reverted to working baseline
Ready:  1.20 📦 TTA ready to submit
Goal:   1.00 🎯 Attention model target
