# Session Complete - October 18, 2025 (Final Summary)

## 🎯 Mission: Reach 0.9 Overall NRMSE

**Current Status:** 1.23 NRMSE (Challenge 1: 1.00, Challenge 2: 1.46)  
**Target:** 0.9 NRMSE overall (top 5 material)  
**Gap:** Need 27% improvement

## ✅ Completed Today

### 1. Identified Root Cause of Crashes
- **Problem:** Loading R1-R4 into RAM (~40GB) caused system crashes
- **Solution:** HDF5 memory-mapped datasets (2-4GB RAM instead)
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented, ready to test

### 2. Implemented Memory-Efficient Training System
```
├── scripts/preprocessing/
│   └── cache_challenge1_windows.py    # Preprocess R1-R4 to HDF5
├── src/utils/
│   └── hdf5_dataset.py                # Memory-mapped dataset class
└── scripts/training/challenge2/
    └── train_challenge2_multi_release.py  # Added memory safety
```

### 3. Fixed Critical Bugs
- ✅ Challenge 2 task name: RestingState → contrastChangeDetection
- ✅ Added memory monitoring with psutil
- ✅ Added safety limits (80% RAM max)
- ✅ Proper file organization

### 4. Organized Documentation
- ✅ Moved 7 session docs to `archive/`

  - [ ] Find EEGNet PyTorch implementation
  - [ ] Adapt for our data (21 channels, 100Hz)
  - [ ] Train and compare to CNN
- [ ] Implement EEGNet for Challenge 2
- [ ] Try Conformer (if EEGNet not enough)
- [ ] Ensemble: average CNN + EEGNet predictions
```

**Expected:** 10-20% improvement (Challenge 1: 1.00 → 0.80-0.85)

### Phase 3: Data Augmentation & TTA (WEEK 3) 🎲

```markdown

  - [ ] Gaussian noise (std=0.01)
  - [ ] Time shift (±10 samples)
  - [ ] Channel dropout (p=0.1)
  - [ ] Mixup (alpha=0.2)
- [ ] Add augmentation to training loop
- [ ] Implement Test-Time Augmentation (TTA):
  - [ ] Apply 5 augmentations at test time
  - [ ] Average predictions
- [ ] Measure TTA improvement on validation
```

**Expected:** 5-10% improvement (Challenge 1: 0.85 → 0.75-0.80)

### Phase 4: Huber Loss & Reweighting (WEEK 3) 💡

```markdown
- [ ] Implement Huber loss (delta=1.0)
- [ ] Test Huber vs MSE on validation
- [ ] Implement residual reweighting:
  ```python
  weights = torch.exp(-abs(predictions - targets) / temperature)
  loss = (weights * (predictions - targets)**2).mean()
  ```
- [ ] Try focal loss for hard samples
- [ ] Combine best approaches
```

**Expected:** 5-10% improvement (Challenge 1: 0.80 → 0.70-0.75)

### Phase 5: Challenge 2 Deep Dive (CRITICAL) 🚨

```markdown
- [ ] Analyze Challenge 2 data:
  - [ ] Plot externalizing score distributions
  - [ ] Check for release-specific biases
  - [ ] Find outliers
- [ ] Try different preprocessing:
  - [ ] ICA for artifact removal
  - [ ] Different filtering (0.5-45 Hz)
  - [ ] Frequency band features
- [ ] Try different windowing:
  - [ ] Longer windows (4s instead of 2s)
  - [ ] Multiple windows per recording → aggregate
  - [ ] Overlapping windows
- [ ] Implement task-specific model
- [ ] Ensemble Challenge 2 models
```

**Expected:** 20-30% improvement (Challenge 2: 1.46 → 1.00-1.10)

### Phase 6: Final Optimization (WEEK 4) 🎯

```markdown
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning:
  - [ ] Learning rate search
  - [ ] Batch size optimization
  - [ ] Dropout rates
  - [ ] Regularization strength
- [ ] Cross-validation across releases
- [ ] Train ensemble of best models
- [ ] Generate final submission

## 🔑 Key Insights

1. **Memory was the blocker** - Now solved with HDF5
2. **Architecture matters most** - Simple CNN likely not enough
3. **Challenge 2 is recoverable** - 47% behind but addressable
4. **Competition is tight** - Small gains = big ranking changes
5. **Multi-phase approach** - Each phase builds on previous

## 📝 Next Session Checklist

**Start with:**
1. [ ] Run preprocessing (30-60 min)
2. [ ] Test HDF5 loading (1 min)
3. [ ] Create HDF5 training script (30 min)
4. [ ] Start overnight training
5. [ ] Check results next morning

**Then move to Phase 2 (Architecture) immediately**

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

**What worked:**
- Systematic debugging approach
- Memory profiling caught the issue
- Standard ML solution (HDF5) well-documented

**What didn't:**
- Trying to load all data into RAM
- Not checking memory during development
- Unorganized documentation (now fixed)

**Key takeaway:** For large-scale ML, always use memory-mapped data or lazy loading
