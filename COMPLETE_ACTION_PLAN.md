cp = torch.load('checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_real_best.pth', map_location='cpu', weights_only=False)
print(f'Val Loss: {cp[\"val_loss\"]:.6f}')
print(f'Correlation: {cp[\"correlation\"]:.4f}')
print(f'Epoch: {cp[\"epoch\"]}')
with open('checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_real_history.json') as f:
    h = json.load(f)
    print(f'Total Epochs: {len(h)}')
"

# Update submission

## ⚡ Quick Actions

### If Training Fails
```bash
# Check error in log
tail -100 logs/train_tcn_working_*.log

# Restart with smaller data
# Edit scripts/train_tcn_simple_working.py:
# Change: n_train: 3000 → 1000, n_val: 600 → 200

# Or use synthetic model we already have
cp checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_enhanced_best.pth checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_real_best.pth
python3 scripts/update_submission.py
```

### If ZIP Too Large (>50 MB)
```bash
# Quantize model to FP16
python3 -c "
import torch
cp = torch.load('challenge1_tcn_enhanced.pth', map_location='cpu')
for k in cp:
    if isinstance(cp[k], torch.Tensor):
        cp[k] = cp[k].half()
torch.save(cp, 'challenge1_tcn_enhanced_fp16.pth')
"
# Update scripts/update_submission.py to use FP16 version
```

### If Submission Errors
```bash
# Validate submission format
python3 -c "
import zipfile
with zipfile.ZipFile('eeg2025_submission_tcn_v6.zip', 'r') as z:
    print('Files:', z.namelist())
    for f in z.namelist():
        print(f'{f}: {z.getinfo(f).file_size / 1024:.1f} KB')
"

# Test locally
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '.')
from submission import predict_challenge_1, predict_challenge_2
import numpy as np
# Test with dummy data
x = np.random.randn(129, 200)
rt = predict_challenge_1(x)
print(f'Challenge 1 prediction: {rt}')
"
```
