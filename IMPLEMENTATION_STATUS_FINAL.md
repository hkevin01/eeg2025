## 🏁 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Next 2 Hours):

1. **Integrate TTA into submission.py**
   ```python
   # In submission.py, import:
   from tta_predictor import TTAPredictor
   
   # Wrap model predictions:
   tta = TTAPredictor(model, num_augments=10, device='cpu')
   prediction = tta.predict(x)
   ```

2. **Create submission_v5.zip**
   ```bash
   cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
   python create_submission_v5.py
   ```

3. **Upload to Codabench**
   - Wait for test results (1-2 hours)
   - Compare with validation
   - Adjust strategy based on degradation

### Tomorrow:

4. **If CV checkpoints exist, create ensemble**
5. **Start training TCN model overnight**
6. **Monitor results from today's submission**

### This Week:

7. **Train S4 model (cutting-edge)**
