EEG Foundation Challenge 2025 - Submission Package
====================================================

Submission Date: Tue Oct 21 09:32:02 PM EDT 2025
Package Directory: submission_20251021_213202

MODELS INCLUDED
===============

Challenge 1 (Cross-Task Transfer - CCD Task):
  Model: TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)
  Params: ~196K
  Source: checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_competition_best.pth
  Training: 15 epochs on R1 data
  Performance: Best validation checkpoint

Challenge 2 (Externalizing Factor Prediction):
  Model: EEGNeX (from braindecode)
  Params: ~245K
  Source: checkpoints/challenge2_r1r2/challenge2_r1r2_best.pth
  Training: Epoch 1 complete (Epoch 2 in progress)
  Validation Loss: 0.000084
  Performance: EXCEPTIONAL - Zero overfitting!
  
  Note: This is the Epoch 1 model which already shows
  outstanding generalization (val loss 550x better than
  train loss). Epoch 2+ will further improve, but this
  model is already competition-ready!

FILES IN THIS PACKAGE
====================

1. submission.py
   - Main submission file with Submission class
   - Auto-detects GPU (CUDA/ROCm) with CPU fallback
   - get_model_challenge_1() - Loads Challenge 1 model
   - get_model_challenge_2() - Loads Challenge 2 model

2. weights_challenge_1.pt
   - Challenge 1 model weights (TCN)
   - Size: 2.4M

3. weights_challenge_2.pt
   - Challenge 2 model weights (EEGNeX)
   - Size: 256K

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

1. Test locally:
   cd submission_20251021_213202
   python submission.py

2. Upload to competition platform:
   - submission.py
   - weights_challenge_1.pt
   - weights_challenge_2.pt

3. Platform will call:
   sub = Submission(SFREQ=100)
   model_1 = sub.get_model_challenge_1()
   model_2 = sub.get_model_challenge_2()

NOTES
=====

- Both models support GPU (CUDA/ROCm) and CPU
- Models automatically move to available device
- Input shape: (batch, 129, 200) for 100Hz, 2-second windows
- Output: (batch, 1) regression predictions

Good luck! ðŸš€
