# .gitignore Updates - C2 Training Session

**Date**: October 31, 2025, 00:22 EST

## ðŸ“‹ Added Patterns

### C2 Training Logs
```
logs/c2_phase1_*.log
logs/c2_phase2_*.log
logs/c2_*_cpu_*.log
logs/c2_*_gpu_*.log
logs/train_c2_*.log
logs/training_c2_*.log
```

**Why**: These are large training logs (multiple GB over time) that don't need version control.

### C2 Checkpoints
```
checkpoints/c2_phase1_*.pt
checkpoints/c2_phase2_*.pt

# Exception (kept):
!checkpoints/c2_phase1_best.pt
```

**Why**: Training checkpoints are large (50-200MB). We keep only the best final model.

### C2 Status Documents
```
C2_TRAINING_STATUS.md
C2_OVERNIGHT_STATUS.md
C2_IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGY.md
OVERNIGHT_PLAN.md
ROOT_CAUSE_FOUND.md
ENSEMBLE_FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md
INVESTIGATION_AND_TTA_RESULTS.md
```

**Why**: These are ephemeral status documents generated during development sessions. Final documentation should be in `docs/`.

### C2 Training Scripts (Root Directory)
```
train_c2_phase1.py
train_c2_phase1_bids.py
train_c2_phase2_ensemble.py
morning_check_c2.sh
test_c2_improved.py
```

**Why**: These are temporary scripts created in root for quick access during training. Should be moved to `scripts/training/` if kept permanently.

## âœ… What Gets Committed

### Always Committed:
- Source code in `src/`
- Documentation in `docs/` (except status/planning subdirs)
- Configuration files
- README.md and core documentation
- Small submission weights (<10MB)
- Test files in `tests/`

### Conditionally Committed:
- `checkpoints/c2_phase1_best.pt` - If training succeeds and improves over baseline
- Important analysis documents (moved to `docs/analysis/`)
- Final submission packages (in `submissions/phase1_v9/`)

### Never Committed:
- Large data files (>100MB)
- Training logs
- Temporary status documents
- Development/debug scripts in root
- Cache files and temporary outputs

## ðŸ”§ Cleanup Commands

### To see what would be ignored:
```bash
git status --ignored
```

### To remove tracked files that should be ignored:
```bash
git rm --cached logs/c2_phase1_*.log
git rm --cached C2_TRAINING_STATUS.md
git rm --cached train_c2_phase1*.py
```

### To clean untracked ignored files:
```bash
git clean -fdX  # Remove ignored files
git clean -fdn  # Dry run - see what would be removed
```

## ðŸ“Š Impact

**Files now ignored**: ~15-20 temporary files from C2 training session
**Space saved**: Potentially several GB if logs/checkpoints accumulate
**Repository cleaner**: Focus on permanent code and documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Training scripts**: Create in `scripts/training/`, not root
2. **Status documents**: Use `docs/status/` or keep as ephemeral notes
3. **Checkpoints**: Only commit final best models, ignore intermediate
4. **Logs**: Keep locally for debugging, never commit

## âœ… Verification

Check current status:
```bash
git status
```

Should show:
- `.gitignore` (modified)
- Important new files (if any)
- Should NOT show temporary logs, checkpoints, or status docs
