## 🎯 After Training Completes

### Immediate Actions

#### 1. Validate Training Results
```bash
# Check training log
cat logs/train_tcn_real_*.log

# Load and inspect checkpoint
python3 -c "
import torch
import json

# Load best checkpoint
checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_real_best.pth', map_location='cpu')
print('Best Model:')
print(f'  Val Loss: {checkpoint[\"val_loss\"]:.6f}')
print(f'  Correlation: {checkpoint[\"correlation\"]:.4f}')
print(f'  Epoch: {checkpoint[\"epoch\"]}')

# Load history
with open('checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_real_history.json', 'r') as f:
    history = json.load(f)
print(f'  Total Epochs: {len(history)}')
"
```

#### 2. Update Submission
```bash
# Integrate trained model into submission
python3 scripts/update_submission.py

# This will:
# - Load trained model from checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_real_best.pth
# - Update submission.py with TCN architecture
# - Create challenge1_tcn_enhanced.pth (standalone weights)
# - Create eeg2025_submission_tcn_v6.zip
# - Validate ZIP format and size
```

#### 3. Upload to Competition
```bash
# Upload the new submission
File: eeg2025_submission_tcn_v6.zip
URL: https://www.codabench.org/competitions/4287/
Expected Size: ~12-15 MB (depending on model)
Expected Time: 5 minutes upload, 1-2 hours for results
```

### Submission Comparison

#### v5 (Current - TTA Only)
```
Status: Ready, not uploaded yet
Models: Baseline CNN + TTA
Size: 9.3 MB
Expected: 0.25-0.26 NRMSE (5-10% improvement)
Estimated Rank: Top 15
```

#### v6 (Next - TCN + Real Data + TTA)
```
Status: Training in progress
Models: Enhanced TCN (trained on real data) + TTA
Size: ~12-15 MB (estimated)
Expected: 0.21-0.22 NRMSE (20-25% improvement)
Estimated Rank: Top 5-10
Priority: HIGH - Upload immediately after training
```

## 🚀 Next Steps After v6

### Short-Term (1-3 days)
1. **Upload v5** (if v6 training looks good, might skip v5)
2. **Monitor v6 results** on leaderboard
3. **Analyze errors** from v6 predictions
4. **Train ensemble** (5 TCN variants with different seeds)

### Medium-Term (4-7 days)
1. **Train S4 State Space Model** (potentially best single model)
2. **Multi-task learning** (joint Challenge 1+2)
3. **Hyperparameter optimization** (learning rate, architecture, etc.)
4. **Create super-ensemble** (TCN + S4 + others)

### Long-Term (8-16 days until deadline)
1. **Cloud GPU training** for larger models
2. **Advanced ensemble** with weighted averaging
3. **Submission optimization** (v7, v8, v9...)
4. **Final push** for #1 ranking

## 📊 Training Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Real-time log monitoring
tail -f logs/train_tcn_real_*.log

# Check last 50 lines
tail -50 logs/train_tcn_real_*.log

# Check if still running
ps aux | grep train_tcn_real_data

# Check GPU/CPU usage
htop

# Check memory usage
free -h

# Count processed subjects (from cache)
ls -1 data/processed/p300_cache/*.npz 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# Check checkpoint sizes
ls -lh checkpoints/challenge1_tcn_real*

## ⚠️ Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Data Loading Fails
**Symptom:** "No data loaded! Check BIDS directory structure."
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check BIDS structure
ls -R data/raw/ds005505-bdf/ | head -50

# Verify BDF files exist
find data/raw/ds005505-bdf -name "*.bdf" | wc -l

# If missing, check alternate datasets
ls data/raw/
```

### Issue 2: Out of Memory
**Symptom:** Training crashes with memory error
**Solution:**
```bash
# Training already uses CPU and small batches
# If still issues, reduce batch size in script:
# Change: batch_size: 8 → 4
# Or close other applications
```

### Issue 3: Slow Training
**Symptom:** > 5 minutes per epoch
**Solution:**
```bash
# Data caching speeds up after first run
# Check cache created:
ls -lh data/processed/p300_cache/

# First run: 5-15 min
# Subsequent runs: 30-90 sec per epoch
```

### Issue 4: Poor Validation Results
**Symptom:** High validation loss or negative correlation
**Solution:**
```bash
# Normal for early epochs
# Early stopping will handle this
# If persists after 20+ epochs:
# - Check data quality
# - Verify preprocessing
# - Try different learning rate
```
