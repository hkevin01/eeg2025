- **Fixed Submission:** Expected ~1.0 (C1: 1.002 ✅, C2: 1.009 ✅)

### Key Insights
- Challenge 1 has severe overfitting (val 0.28 → test 3.94)
- Subject-level CV is critical for realistic validation
- SAM optimizer should reduce generalization gap
- Current 758KB weights performed nearly perfectly

## 🚨 Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- **None** - All core components working ✅

### Potential Risks
1. **Data loading integration** - May need debugging
   - Mitigation: Test incrementally, use existing dataio module
   
2. **Training time** - 100 epochs may take several hours
   - Mitigation: Use GPU, implement early stopping
   
3. **Memory constraints** - 6GB VRAM may limit batch size
   - Mitigation: Reduce batch size if needed (16 or 8)
   
4. **Overfitting still present** - SAM may not fully solve it
   - Mitigation: Ensemble methods, more aggressive augmentation
