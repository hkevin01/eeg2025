# Session Summary - Part 4: Path to 0.9 NRMSE

**Goal:** 1.23 → 0.9 overall NRMSE (25% improvement needed)

## Phase 1: Immediate (This Week)
- ✅ Fix crashes (DONE!)
- ⏳ Preprocessing R1-R4 (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Train Challenge 1 overnight
- [ ] Verify stable training

## Phase 2: Architecture (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement EEGNet (proven for EEG)
- [ ] Add Huber loss (robust to outliers)
- [ ] Residual connections
- [ ] Target: C1 → 0.85, C2 → 1.20

## Phase 3: Data & Augmentation (Week 3)
- [ ] Gaussian noise augmentation
- [ ] Time shifting
- [ ] Channel dropout
- [ ] Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)
- [ ] Target: C1 → 0.75, C2 → 1.10

## Phase 4: Challenge 2 Focus (Week 3-4)
**47% behind - needs special attention!**
- [ ] Analyze externalizing score distribution
- [ ] Task-specific preprocessing
- [ ] Multi-scale temporal features
- [ ] Attention mechanisms
- [ ] Target: C2 → 1.00

## Phase 5: Final Push (Week 4)
- [ ] Ensemble methods
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Cross-validation
- [ ] Target: Overall → 0.87-0.91 (Top 5!)

## Key Insight
Top 5 teams are within 0.2% (0.984-0.986)
= Very tight competition! Small improvements matter!
