# 🚀 Training In Progress - October 18, 2025

## Status: RUNNING ✅

**Started:** October 18, 2025 at 15:42 (restarted)
**Process:** PID 734250 (Challenge 1)
**Expected Completion:** ~3 hours per challenge (Challenge 1: ~18:30, Challenge 2: ~21:30)

## What's Running

### Challenge 1: Response Time Prediction
- **Status:** RUNNING (window creation phase)
- **Training Data:** R1, R2, R3, R4 (719 subjects, +33% more than baseline)
- **Validation Data:** R5 (240 subjects)
- **Key Improvements:**
  - ✅ Stimulus-aligned windows (not trial-aligned)
  - ✅ R4 training data added (+33%)
  - ✅ L1 + L2 + Dropout regularization (Elastic Net)
  - ✅ Enhanced model architecture

### Challenge 2: Behavior Prediction
- **Status:** QUEUED (will start after Challenge 1)
- **Training Data:** R1, R2, R3, R4 (719 subjects)
- **Validation Data:** R5
- **Key Improvements:**
  - ✅ R4 training data added (+33%)
  - ✅ L1 + L2 + Dropout regularization (Elastic Net)

## Baseline Scores (Before Improvements)

| Challenge | Baseline NRMSE | Training Data | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Challenge 1 | 1.00 | R1-R2 (479 subj) | Trial-aligned ❌ |
| Challenge 2 | 1.46 | R1-R2 (479 subj) | Standard |
| **Combined** | **1.23** | - | Average |

---

## Expected Results (After Improvements)

| Challenge | Conservative | Optimistic | Stretch | Expected Gain |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------|---------------|
| Challenge 1 | 0.75 | 0.70 | 0.65 | 25-35% |
| Challenge 2 | 1.30 | 1.25 | 1.20 | 12-18% |
| **Combined** | **1.03** | **0.98** | **0.93** | **18-24%** |

**Why these improvements?**
- Stimulus alignment: 15-25% gain (Challenge 1 only)
- More training data (+33%): 10-15% gain
- Better regularization: 5-10% gain
- Combined multiplicative effect: 20-35% total gain

## How to Monitor

### Check if training is still running
```bash
ps aux | grep train_and_validate | grep -v grep
```

### Use monitoring script (recommended)
```bash
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
./monitor_training.sh
```

### Watch live progress
```bash
# Challenge 1 (detailed)
tail -f logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_*.log

# Challenge 2 (when it starts)
tail -f logs/training_comparison/challenge2_improved_*.log

# Wrapper (high-level)
tail -f logs/training_comparison/wrapper_*.log
```

### Check for epoch progress
```bash
# See training epochs
grep -E "(Epoch|Train NRMSE|Val NRMSE)" logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_*.log | tail -20
```

---

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Data Loading (COMPLETE)**
- ✅ R1 loaded: 293 datasets
- ✅ R2-R4 loading...

**Phase 2: Window Creation (IN PROGRESS)**
- ⏳ Creating stimulus-aligned windows
- 📋 This outputs many "Used Annotations: stimulus_anchor" messages
- ⏱️ Expected time: ~10-15 minutes

**Phase 3: Model Training (PENDING)**
- 📋 50 epochs per challenge
- 📋 ~2-3 hours per challenge
- 📋 Will show Epoch 1/50, Epoch 2/50, etc.

---

## Troubleshooting

### If training stops unexpectedly
```bash
# Check if process crashed
ps aux | grep train_and_validate

# Look for errors
grep -i error logs/training_comparison/wrapper_*.log
grep -i exception logs/training_comparison/challenge1_*.log
```

### If you need to restart
```bash
# Kill any existing training
pkill -f train_and_validate
pkill -f train_challenge

# Restart
cd /home/kevin/Projects/eeg2025
nohup python3 train_and_validate_all.py > logs/training_comparison/wrapper_restart.log 2>&1 &
```

## What Happens After Training

1. **Review Results**
   ```bash
   grep "Best Val NRMSE" logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_*.log
   grep "Best Val NRMSE" logs/training_comparison/challenge2_improved_*.log
   ```

2. **Compare to Baseline**
   - Baseline Challenge 1: 1.00 NRMSE
   - Baseline Challenge 2: 1.46 NRMSE
   - Target: >15% improvement (Challenge 1 < 0.85, Challenge 2 < 1.24)

3. **Check for Overfitting**
   ```bash
   # Look for train vs val gap
   grep -E "(Train NRMSE|Val NRMSE)" logs/training_comparison/challenge1_improved_*.log | tail -20
   ```
   - Good: Train ≈ Val (gap < 0.05)
   - Bad: Train << Val (gap > 0.15) → Increase regularization

4. **If Results are Good (>15% improvement)**
   ```bash
   python submission.py
   # Then upload to competition platform
   ```

5. **If Results Need Tuning**
   - See REGULARIZATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md for hyperparameter tuning
   - See TRAINING_IMPROVEMENTS_TODO.md for more advanced methods
