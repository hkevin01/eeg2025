## Task Status Details

### P2.1: Scale Data Acquisition (20% Complete)

**Status**: 🟡 In Progress  
**Progress**: Infrastructure ready, working on bulk download

#### Completed ✅

- [x] BIDS structure verified and working
- [x] Data loading pipeline tested with MNE
- [x] Download scripts created and tested
- [x] S3 bucket structure understood

#### In Progress 🟡
- [ ] Bulk download of 50+ subjects
- [ ] Addressing S3 connectivity constraints
- [ ] Creating batch download with retry logic

#### Blocked/Issues ⚠️
- S3 direct access intermittent - need alternative download strategy
- May need to use HTTPS links instead of AWS CLI
- Consider downloading mini-dataset samples first

#### Next Steps
1. Create robust batch download script with fallback
2. Download 10 subjects at a time with verification
3. Document data quality metrics
4. Create train/val/test splits

- [x] Execution plan documented

#### In Progress 🟡
- [ ] Resolving package dependencies (wandb)
- [ ] Making training script dependencies optional
- [ ] Testing training pipeline on 2 subjects

#### Blocked/Issues ⚠️

- Need to simplify or fix dependencies
- May use baseline training as interim solution

#### Next Steps
1. Install missing dependencies OR make them optional
2. Run initial training on 2 subjects
3. Monitor training metrics
4. Verify model checkpointing works
5. Scale up as more data arrives

### P2.5: Model Optimization (0% Complete)

**Status**: ⭕ Not Started  
**Dependencies**: P2.3, P2.4 (trained models)

#### Plan
- Profile inference latency
- Apply quantization (FP32 → FP16 → INT8)
- Implement operator fusion
- Test TensorRT compilation
- Benchmark and iterate

#### Target Metrics
- Inference: <50ms average (currently 186ms)
- P95 latency: <75ms
- Accuracy degradation: <2%

#### Estimated Start
After initial models are trained

## Current Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: S3 Data Download
**Issue**: Direct S3 access intermittent  
**Impact**: Can't bulk download 50+ subjects quickly  
**Solution**:
- Use existing 2 subjects for initial development
- Create robust retry logic for batch downloads
- Consider HTTPS fallback
- Parallelize: develop while downloading

### Challenge 2: Training Dependencies
**Issue**: Advanced training script requires wandb  
**Impact**: Can't run training immediately  
**Solution**:
- Make wandb optional in training script OR
- Install wandb OR
- Use simpler baseline training temporarily

### Challenge 3: Limited Data
**Issue**: Only 2 subjects currently available  
**Impact**: Can't train robust model yet  
**Solution**:
- Start with 2-subject baseline
- Designed for incremental scaling
- Retrain as more data arrives
- Focus on pipeline validation first

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| S3 download fails | Medium | High | Use HTTPS fallback, download in small batches |
| Training dependencies | Low | Medium | Install packages or use simpler baseline |
| Limited data quality | Medium | High | Verify each download, implement quality checks |
| Training time too long | Medium | Medium | Start with small model, use GPU if available |
| Challenge metrics not met | Medium | High | Iterate on architecture, try different approaches |
