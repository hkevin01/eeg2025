## 1. Overview

Our submission addresses two prediction tasks from EEG data:
- **Challenge 1:** Response time prediction from Contrast Change Detection (CCD) task
- **Challenge 2:** Externalizing factor prediction from Resting State EEG

**Key Innovation:** Multi-release training strategy to address distribution shift between training and test sets.

---

## 2. Dataset

- Release R5: Validation set (~60 subjects)
- Release R12: Held-out test set (organizers only)

**EEG Configuration:**
- Channels: 129 (128 + reference)
- Sampling rate: 100 Hz
- Window size: 2 seconds (200 samples)

---

## 3. Challenge 1: Response Time Prediction

### 3.1 Task
Predict reaction time from EEG during Contrast Change Detection task, where participants identify which of two flickering gratings has dominant contrast.

### 3.2 Data Processing

**Trial Extraction:**
- Task: Contrast Change Detection (CCD)
- Trial annotation using `braindecode.preprocessing.annotate_trials_with_target`
- Requirements: Both stimulus and response present
- Shift: 0.0s after stimulus onset
- Epoch length: 2.0 seconds

**Windowing:**
- Method: `create_fixed_length_windows` from braindecode
- Window size: 200 samples (2 seconds @ 100 Hz)
- Stride: 200 samples (non-overlapping)
- Target: Response time extracted from trial metadata

**Key Fix:** 
Windows created with `targets_from="metadata"` return event type (0/1) as `y`, not response time. We extract `response_time` directly from window metadata dictionary.

```python
# Extract response_time from metadata (not y which is event marker)
if isinstance(metadata, list):
    meta_dict = metadata[0] if len(metadata) > 0 else {}
else:
    meta_dict = metadata

response_time = meta_dict.get('response_time', 0.0)
```

### 3.3 Model Architecture

**CompactResponseTimeCNN** (200,048 parameters)

```
Input: (129 channels, 200 timepoints)

Features:
  Conv1D(129→32, k=7, s=2, p=3) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
  Conv1D(32→64, k=5, s=2, p=2) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.4)
  Conv1D(64→128, k=3, s=2, p=1) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.5)
  AdaptiveAvgPool1D(1) + Flatten

Regressor:
  Linear(128→64) + ReLU + Dropout(0.5)
  Linear(64→32) + ReLU + Dropout(0.4)
  Linear(32→1)

Output: Response time (continuous value)
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **75% parameter reduction** (vs 800K baseline) to prevent overfitting
- **Progressive dropout** (0.3→0.4→0.5) for strong regularization
- **Simple architecture** to learn robust features across releases

### 3.4 Training

**Optimizer:** AdamW
- Learning rate: 1e-3
- Weight decay: 1e-4 (L2 regularization)
- Scheduler: CosineAnnealingLR (T_max=50)

**Loss:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)

**Evaluation Metric:** Normalized RMSE
```
NRMSE = RMSE / std(targets)
```

**Training Strategy:**
- Epochs: 50 (with early stopping after 15 epochs no improvement)
- Batch size: 32
- Gradient clipping: max_norm=1.0
- Early stopping patience: 15 epochs

**Data:**
- Train: R1-R4 (multi-release)
- Validation: R5 (cross-release validation)
- Normalization: Per-window z-score (channel-wise)

## 4. Challenge 2: Externalizing Factor Prediction

### 4.1 Task
Predict externalizing psychopathology factor from resting state EEG. Externalizing represents outward-directed behavioral traits (impulsivity, activity level, rule-challenging).

### 4.2 Data Processing

**Continuous Recording:**
- Task: RestingState (eyes open/closed)
- No trial structure (continuous EEG)
- Total duration: ~3-5 minutes per subject

**Windowing:**
- Method: `create_fixed_length_windows` from braindecode
- Window size: 200 samples (2 seconds @ 100 Hz)
- Stride: 100 samples (50% overlap)
- Purpose: Extract multiple samples per subject

**Target Extraction:**
- Externalizing scores stored in `dataset.description['externalizing']` (subject-level)
- For each window, we map back to parent dataset to retrieve score
- All windows from same subject share same externalizing score

**Key Fix:**
RestingState has no trial-level metadata. Externalizing is a subject-level score that must be extracted from dataset description and mapped to each window.

```python
# During initialization: map windows to externalizing scores
for win_idx in range(len(windows_dataset)):
    _, _, win_metadata = windows_dataset[win_idx]
    
    # Get which dataset this window came from
    if isinstance(win_metadata, list) and len(win_metadata) > 0:
        dataset_ind = win_metadata[0].get('i_dataset', 0)
    else:
        dataset_ind = 0
    
    # Get externalizing score from that dataset
    orig_dataset = dataset.datasets[dataset_ind]
    externalizing_score = orig_dataset.description.get('externalizing', 0.0)
    
    self.externalizing_scores.append(externalizing_score)

# In __getitem__: use pre-computed score
externalizing = self.externalizing_scores[idx]
```

### 4.3 Model Architecture

**CompactExternalizingCNN** (64,001 parameters)

```
Input: (129 channels, 200 timepoints)

Features:
  Conv1D(129→32, k=7, s=2, p=3) + BatchNorm + ELU + Dropout(0.3)
  Conv1D(32→64, k=5, s=2, p=2) + BatchNorm + ELU + Dropout(0.4)
  Conv1D(64→96, k=3, s=2, p=1) + BatchNorm + ELU + Dropout(0.5)
  AdaptiveAvgPool1D(1) + Flatten

Regressor:
  Linear(96→48) + ELU + Dropout(0.5)
  Linear(48→24) + ELU + Dropout(0.4)
  Linear(24→1)

Output: Externalizing factor (continuous value)
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **75% parameter reduction** (vs 600K baseline) to prevent overfitting
- **ELU activations** instead of ReLU for smoother gradients
- **Even smaller** (64K params) due to simpler task (subject-level vs trial-level)
- **Progressive dropout** (0.3→0.4→0.5) for regularization

### 4.4 Training

**Optimizer:** AdamW
- Learning rate: 1e-3
- Weight decay: 1e-4
- Scheduler: CosineAnnealingLR (T_max=50)

**Loss:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)

**Evaluation Metric:** Normalized RMSE

**Training Strategy:**
- Epochs: 50 (with early stopping after 15 epochs no improvement)
- Batch size: 32
- Gradient clipping: max_norm=1.0
- Early stopping patience: 15 epochs

**Data:**
- Train: R1-R4 RestingState recordings (multi-release)
- Validation: R5 RestingState
- Normalization: Per-window z-score (channel-wise)

## 5. Multi-Release Training Strategy

### 5.1 Problem

Previous single-release approach:
- Trained on R5 only
- Validated on R5 (same data)
- Tested on R12 (different distribution)
- **Result:** 10-14x performance degradation on test set

### 5.2 Solution

**Cross-Release Training:**
1. **Train:** Combine R1, R2, R3, R4 (diverse subjects, ~240 total)
2. **Validate:** Use R5 (simulates distribution shift to R12)
3. **Test:** Evaluated on R12 by organizers

**Benefits:**
- Model sees diverse subjects across releases
- Validation on different release catches overfitting
- Better generalization to held-out R12

### 5.3 Comparison

| Approach | Training | Validation | Test (R12) | Degradation |
|----------|----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Old** | R5 | R5 | Poor | 10-14x |
| **New** | R1-R4 | R5 | Expected Good | ~2x |

## 6. Implementation Details

### 6.1 Data Loading

**Corrupted File Handling:**
- Test each dataset by accessing `raw.n_times`
- Skip corrupted files
- Log all skipped datasets

**Multi-Release Dataset:**
- Load each release separately
- Check and skip corrupted files
- Create windows for each release
- Concatenate all windows
- Track release label for each window

### 6.2 Normalization

**Per-Window Z-Score Normalization:**
```python
X_norm = (X - mean(X, axis=channels)) / (std(X, axis=channels) + 1e-8)
```

Applied independently to each window to handle:
- Different EEG amplitudes across subjects
- Baseline drift within recordings
- Impedance variations

### 6.3 Training Loop

```python
for epoch in range(50):
    # Training
    model.train()
    for X_batch, y_batch in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        predictions = model(X_batch)
        loss = criterion(predictions, y_batch)
        loss.backward()
        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
        optimizer.step()
    
    # Validation
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        val_predictions = []
        val_targets = []
        for X_val, y_val in val_loader:
            pred = model(X_val)
            val_predictions.append(pred)
            val_targets.append(y_val)
        
        nrmse = compute_nrmse(val_targets, val_predictions)
        
        if nrmse < best_nrmse:
            best_nrmse = nrmse
            save_checkpoint()
            patience_counter = 0
        else:
            patience_counter += 1
        
        if patience_counter >= 15:
            break  # Early stopping
    
    scheduler.step()
```

## 10. Lessons Learned

### 10.1 Critical Bugs Found and Fixed

1. **Challenge 1 Target Bug:** Windows return event type (0/1) as `y`, not response time. Must extract from metadata.

2. **Challenge 2 Target Bug:** RestingState has no trial metadata. Externalizing scores are subject-level in dataset description, must be mapped to windows.

3. **Metadata Format:** Braindecode windows return metadata as list of dicts (one per window), not single dict.

4. **Architecture Mismatch:** Submission model must exactly match training model architecture.

5. **Distribution Shift:** Single-release training catastrophically fails on held-out release.

### 10.2 Best Practices

- ✅ Always verify targets are correct (check for constant predictions)
- ✅ Use cross-release validation to catch distribution shift
- ✅ Smaller models with strong regularization generalize better
- ✅ Check NRMSE ≠ 0.0 (indicates constant predictions)
- ✅ Match submission.py architecture exactly to training

## 11. Conclusion

Our multi-release training approach with compact, well-regularized CNN architectures addresses the critical distribution shift problem in the EEG Foundation Challenge. By training on diverse releases (R1-R4) and validating on a held-out release (R5), we expect 2-3x improvement over single-release approaches. The key innovations are:

1. **Multi-release training** for robustness
2. **Compact architectures** (75% parameter reduction)
3. **Strong regularization** (dropout 0.3-0.5, weight decay)
4. **Proper target extraction** from metadata
5. **Cross-release validation** to simulate test conditions

This approach should generalize well to the unseen R12 test set.
