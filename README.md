# 🧠 NeurIPS 2025 EEG Foundation Challenge - Competition Journey

**Competition:** [EEG Foundation Challenge](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/3350/)  
**Team:** hkevin01  
**Duration:** October 17 - November 1, 2025  
**Status:** V12 Failed → V13 In Development  
**Best Score:** V10 - Overall 1.00052, Rank #72/150

---

## 📊 Competition Overview

### Tasks
- **Challenge 1 (CCD):** Predict response time from EEG during continuous choice discrimination
  - Input: 129 channels × 200 timepoints (100 Hz, 2 seconds)
  - Output: Single response time value per trial
  
- **Challenge 2 (RSVP):** Predict externalizing factor from resting-state EEG
  - Input: 129 channels × 200 timepoints (100 Hz, 2 seconds)  
  - Output: Single externalizing score per trial

- **Metric:** NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error)
  - Lower is better (best scores on leaderboard: C1 0.89854, Overall 0.97367)
  - Baseline reference point normalized to 1.0

### Critical Discovery
**Our initial understanding: NRMSE normalized to 1.0 baseline**
- We initially thought scores < 1.0 were impossible
- Top leaderboard shows scores like 0.89854 (C1) and 0.97367 (overall)
- **Reality:** Competition uses different normalization or our understanding incomplete
- However, V10 C1 at 1.00019 is still an incredibly small margin = only **1.9e-4 above 1.0**
- This tiny margin completely changed our strategy regardless of normalization details

## 🗺️ Competition Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Exploration (Oct 17-20)

**Goal:** Understand data and establish baseline

**Data Challenges:**
- ❌ Event parsing issues: `trial_start` vs `buttonPress` confusion
- ❌ Channel mismatch: 129 vs 63 channels across datasets
- ❌ Missing preprocessed data files
- ✅ Solution: Created HDF5 preprocessing pipeline (679 MB for C1)

**Architecture Exploration:**
Tried multiple architectures to find best performers:

| Architecture | Challenge | Result | Why It Failed/Succeeded |
|-------------|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| Basic CNN | C1 | ❌ Overfit | Too simple, no regularization |
| EEGNet | C1 | ❌ Unstable | Gradient issues |
| **CompactCNN** | C1 | ✅ Success | Good balance: 3 conv layers + attention |
| TCN | C1 | ❌ Slow | Too deep for 2-second windows |
| Transformer | C1 | ❌ Overfit | Too many parameters for small data |
| LSTM | C2 | ❌ Underfit | Struggled with spatial structure |
| **EEGNeX** | C2 | ✅ Success | State-of-art for EEG, depthwise convs |

**Key Learning:** Simpler models with proper regularization > complex architectures

---

### Phase 2: First Success - V9 (Oct 21-23)

**Approach:**
- Challenge 1: CompactCNN with heavy dropout (0.5-0.6)
- Challenge 2: EEGNeX from braindecode

**Results:**
- C1: 1.00077
- C2: 1.00870  
- Overall: 1.00648
- Rank: #88/150

**Problems Encountered:**
- ❌ C2 training instability
- ❌ ROCm GPU memory issues (AMD 6700XT)
- ❌ Checkpoint format confusion
- ✅ Solution: CPU training + better checkpointing

**What Worked:**
- Aggressive dropout prevented overfitting
- EMA (Exponential Moving Average) improved generalization
- Subject-aware train/val splits

---

### Phase 3: Architecture Refinement - V10 (Oct 24-27)

**Improvements:**
1. **Enhanced CompactCNN for C1:**
   - Added spatial attention mechanism
   - Increased dropout: 0.6 → 0.7
   - Better feature extraction pathway

2. **EEGNeX Fine-tuning for C2:**
   - Proper hyperparameter search
   - Better data augmentation
   - EMA with decay 0.999

**Data Augmentation Strategy:**
- TimeShift: ±10ms (safe for EEG)
- GaussianNoise: SNR 0.5 (realistic)
- ChannelDropout: 10% (robustness)

**Results:**
- ✅ C1: **1.00019** (massive improvement!)
- ✅ C2: **1.00066** (5.4x better than V9)
- ✅ Overall: **1.00052**
- ✅ Rank: **#72/150** (16 positions up!)

**Critical Discovery:**
C1 at 1.00019 means only **0.00019 (1.9e-4)** above the theoretical minimum of 1.0. This is an incredibly tiny margin!

**Strategic Implication:**
Traditional architecture improvements (bigger models, more layers) have HIGH RISK of degradation at this margin. Need variance reduction instead.

---

### Phase 4: The Variance Reduction Strategy (Oct 28-31)

**Problem:** How to improve when already at 1.9e-4 above baseline?

**Solution:** Focus on reducing prediction variance through:
1. Multi-seed ensembles
2. Test-time augmentation (TTA)
3. Calibration

**Challenge 2 Phase 2 Training:**
- Trained 3 seeds: 42, 123, 456
- **Power outage** on Oct 31 interrupted training!
- Recovery: Used best 2 checkpoints (Seeds 42, 123)
- Result: Val loss 0.122-0.126 (excellent)

**Challenge 1 Multi-Seed Training (Nov 1):**
- Prepared data: 7,461 CCD segments from 244 subjects
- Fixed event parsing: Changed `trial_start` → `buttonPress`
- Trained 5 seeds: 42, 123, 456, 789, 1337

**Training Surprise:**
- Expected: 41 hours (8 hours/seed × 5)
- Actual: **11.2 minutes!** (2.2 min/seed)
- Reason: Compact model + efficient HDF5 pipeline

**Results:**
```
Seed    Val NRMSE
────────────────
42      1.486252  ← Best
123     1.490609
456     1.505322
789     1.511281
1337    1.502185
────────────────
Mean    1.499130
Std     0.009314
CV      0.62%     ← Excellent consistency!
```

### Phase 5: Calibration & TTA (Nov 1)

**Calibration Fitting:**
Process:
1. Loaded 5-seed ensemble predictions on validation set (1,492 samples)
2. Tested Ridge regression with α values: [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0]
3. Selected best α = 0.1

Results:
```
Baseline NRMSE:    1.473805
Calibrated NRMSE:  1.473726
Improvement:       0.000079 (7.9e-5) ✅ Measured!
```

Coefficients:
- a = 0.988077 (slight downscaling)
- b = 0.027255 (small bias correction)

**Test-Time Augmentation:**
- 3 circular time shifts: -2, 0, +2 samples (20ms at 100Hz)
- Why circular? No edge artifacts
- Why small shifts? EEG has temporal structure
- Expected gain: 1e-5 to 8e-5

**Total V12 Stack:**
- 5 seeds × 3 TTA = 15 predictions per input
- Average all 15 predictions
- Apply calibration: y_cal = 0.988 * y + 0.027

---

### Phase 6: V11-V12 Creation & Verification (Nov 1)

**Created Three Submissions:**

**V11** (Safe Bet):
- C1: V10 model (proven 1.00019)
- C2: 2-seed ensemble (Seeds 42, 123)
- Size: 1.7 MB
- Expected: Overall ~1.00034

**V11.5** (5-Seed Test):
- C1: 5-seed ensemble only
- C2: 2-seed ensemble
- Size: 6.1 MB
- Expected: Overall ~1.00031

**V12** (Full Variance Reduction):
- C1: 5-seed + TTA + Calibration
- C2: 2-seed ensemble
- Size: 6.1 MB
- Expected: Overall ~1.00030
- Expected rank: #45-55

**Verification Process:**
Comprehensive pre-upload testing:
- ✅ Package integrity (ZIP valid)
- ✅ Code structure (required functions)
- ✅ Input/output format (numpy arrays)
- ✅ Batch sizes [1, 5, 16, 32, 64]
- ✅ No NaN/Inf values
- ✅ Model loading (7 checkpoints)

**Issues Found & Fixed:**
1. ❌ Torch tensor input → ✅ Added numpy conversion
2. ❌ Wrong output shapes → ✅ Added `.squeeze(-1)`
3. ❌ Missing constructor args → ✅ Added `__init__(SFREQ, DEVICE)`
4. ❌ Direct `.to(device)` on numpy → ✅ Convert to torch first

---

### Phase 7: V12 Submission Failure (Nov 1, 2:00 PM)

**Uploaded:** V12 to competition platform

**Result:** ❌ FAILED

**Error Analysis:**
- Downloaded error files: `prediction_result.zip`, `scoring_result.zip`
- `scoring_result.zip` was **empty** → execution failed
- `metadata` showed null exit codes → timeout or crash

**Root Cause Investigation:**

Likely issues:
1. **`weights_only=False` parameter:** Not supported in older PyTorch versions
2. **braindecode import:** May not be available in competition environment
3. **Dependencies:** Competition platform might have limited packages

**Evidence:**
- V10 used braindecode and worked (score 1.00066)
- But competition environment may have changed
- Or V10 was lucky with timing

**Lessons:**
- ✅ Pre-verification caught format issues
- ❌ Didn't test on older PyTorch versions
- ❌ Didn't verify braindecode availability
- ❌ Should have included fallback model definitions

---

### Phase 8: V13 Development & Verification Suite (Nov 1, 2:20 PM)

**Strategy:** Fix V12 issues for robust submission

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Removed `weights_only=False` from `torch.load()` calls (lines 133, 175)
2. ✅ Tested locally with both challenges
3. ✅ Verified batch sizes [1, 5, 16, 32]
4. ✅ Packaged V13.zip (6.1 MB)

**Status:** ✅ Tests passed, ready for upload

#### 🔍 Our Verification Suite

We developed a comprehensive pre-upload testing suite after V12 failure:

**Format Tests:**
```python
✅ Import test: Submission class loads successfully
✅ Initialization: SFREQ=100, DEVICE='cpu' works
✅ Input format: Accepts numpy arrays (not just torch tensors)
✅ Output shape: Returns (N,) not (N, 1)
✅ Output type: Returns numpy.ndarray
✅ No NaN/Inf: All predictions are finite valid numbers
✅ Batch sizes: [1, 5, 16, 32, 64] all work correctly
```

**Challenge-Specific Tests:**
```python
Challenge 1 (CCD):
  ✅ Batch 1: shape (1,), range [3.38, 3.38]
  ✅ Batch 5: shape (5,), range [3.59, 3.81]
  ✅ 5 model checkpoints load successfully
  ✅ Calibration params loaded (a=0.988, b=0.027)
  ✅ TTA: 3 circular shifts work correctly

Challenge 2 (RSVP):
  ✅ Batch 1: shape (1,), range [-0.02, -0.02]
  ✅ Batch 5: shape (5,), range [-0.07, 0.25]
  ✅ 2 model checkpoints load successfully
  ✅ EEGNeX from braindecode imports
```

**File Structure Tests:**
```python
✅ submission.py (11 KB, 341 lines)
✅ c1_phase1_seed42_ema_best.pt (1.05 MB)
✅ c1_phase1_seed123_ema_best.pt (1.05 MB)
✅ c1_phase1_seed456_ema_best.pt (1.05 MB)
✅ c1_phase1_seed789_ema_best.pt (1.05 MB)
✅ c1_phase1_seed1337_ema_best.pt (1.05 MB)
✅ c2_phase2_seed42_ema_best.pt (0.74 MB)
✅ c2_phase2_seed123_ema_best.pt (0.74 MB)
✅ c1_calibration_params.json (195 bytes)
Total: 6.1 MB (under 10 MB limit) ✓
```

**What Verification Caught (Before V12 Upload):**
- Fixed: Torch tensor input → Added numpy conversion
- Fixed: Wrong output shape (N, 1) → Added `.squeeze(-1)`
- Fixed: Missing constructor args → Added `__init__(SFREQ, DEVICE)`
- Fixed: Device error → Convert to torch before `.to(device)`

**What Verification Missed (V12 Failure):**
- PyTorch version compatibility (`weights_only` parameter)
- Older PyTorch version testing (< 1.13)
- Dependency availability in competition environment

**Improved Checklist for V13+:**
```
Format Tests (existing):
✅ Package integrity, code structure, I/O format, batch sizes, no NaN/Inf

Compatibility Tests (NEW):
✅ Test without weights_only parameter
□ Test with PyTorch 1.8, 1.10, 1.12 (if available)
□ Test without external libraries (braindecode fallback)
□ Test in fresh Python environment
□ Include fallback model definitions in submission
```

**Key Insight:** Pre-verification is essential but not sufficient. Must also test:
- Library version compatibility
- Minimal dependency assumptions
- Conservative feature usage

## 🎓 Technical Lessons Learned

### 1. Understanding the Metric (and Our Confusion)
**Initial belief: NRMSE normalized to 1.0 baseline**
- We thought scores < 1.0 were impossible (baseline = theoretical minimum)
- Leaderboard proved us wrong: Best C1 = 0.89854, Overall = 0.97367
- **Lesson:** Don't assume understanding is complete, verify against reality
- **However:** Our 1.9e-4 margin at 1.00019 is still incredibly tight
- Strategy shift still valid: Variance reduction > architecture exploration at tiny margins

### 2. Data Preprocessing is Critical
**Issues we hit:**
- Event parsing: `buttonPress` vs `trial_start`
- Channel counts: 129 vs 63
- Missing files: Required custom preprocessing
- **Solution:** HDF5 pipeline with proper event handling

### 3. Regularization Over Complexity
**Pattern we observed:**
- Simple model + heavy dropout > complex model
- 3-layer CNN outperformed Transformer
- EMA improved all models

### 4. Multi-Seed Ensemble Benefits
**Measured improvements:**
- CV reduced to 0.62% (excellent)
- Robust to initialization
- Expected 5e-5 to 1.2e-4 gain

### 5. Calibration Works at Small Margins
**Surprising result:**
- Even at 1.9e-4 margin, calibration helped
- Linear transform: 7.9e-5 improvement
- Ridge regression (α=0.1) was optimal

### 6. Profile Before Optimizing
**Training speed surprise:**
- Expected: 41 hours
- Actual: 11.2 minutes (200x faster!)
- **Lesson:** Measure, don't assume

### 7. Competition Environment Matters
**V12 failure taught us:**
- Test with minimal dependencies
- Use conservative PyTorch features
- Verify package availability
- Have fallback implementations

### 8. Checkpoint Everything
**Power outage recovery:**
- Lost 1 of 3 training runs
- But had 2 excellent checkpoints
- EMA weights saved the day
- **Lesson:** 2-3 quality seeds > many mediocre

### 9. Test Competition Format Exactly
**Pre-verification saved us:**
- Numpy vs torch tensor issues
- Constructor signature requirements
- Output shape requirements
- Type conversions

### 10. Iterate Fast, Verify Often
**Workflow that worked:**
- Small experiments (minutes)
- Immediate validation
- Document everything
- Test before upload
