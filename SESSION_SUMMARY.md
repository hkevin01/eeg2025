## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### Training Data Opportunity
**You're only using 50% of available data!**

| Release | Subjects | Current Use | Status |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|
| R1 | 239 | ✅ Training | Good |
| R2 | 240 | ✅ Training | Good |
| R3 | 240 | ✅ Validation | Good |
| R4 | 240 | ❌ NOT USED | **OPPORTUNITY** |
| R5 | 240 | ❌ NOT USED | **OPPORTUNITY** |
| R6 | 237 | ❌ NOT USED | Test (accessible) |

**Action**: Add R4 to training = 33% more data!

### Techniques You Can Add
1. **Self-supervised pre-training** (passive tasks) - High impact
2. **Training-time augmentation** - Medium impact
3. **Ensemble learning** (3-5 models) - High impact
4. **Attention mechanisms** - Medium impact
5. **Better loss functions** (Huber, quantile) - Medium impact
6. **Subject-specific normalization** - High impact
7. **Mixup/CutMix** - Medium impact
8. **Gradient accumulation** - Medium impact
9. **Transfer learning** - High impact
10. **Multi-task learning** - Medium impact

**Expected total improvement: 33-67% NRMSE reduction!**

## 📊 Repository Status

### Before Cleanup

- 57,637 raw EEG files at risk
- 2000+ log files tracked
- 700+ archived experiments
- 104-line .gitignore
- Disorganized structure

### After Cleanup
- **381 tracked files** (87.3% reduction)
- Raw EEG properly ignored
- Logs excluded
- Professional structure
- 350+ line .gitignore
- 9 comprehensive docs

### Current Structure
```
136 scripts/    Training & utilities
 64 src/       Source code
 35 docs/      Documentation
 26 tests/     Test files
 24 data/      BIDS metadata only
 96 misc/      Configs, checkpoints, results
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ **DONE**: Verify R4/R5 accessible
2. ✅ **DONE**: Document training opportunities
3. ⏳ **TODO**: Run R1-R6 evaluation (get baseline)
4. ⏳ **TODO**: Test R4 data quality

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Add R4 to training data (1 hour)
2. Implement training-time augmentation (2 hours)
3. Try Huber loss (2 hours)
4. Subject-specific normalization (3 hours)

### Medium-term (Next Week)
1. Self-supervised pre-training on passive tasks (2 days)
2. Ensemble 3-5 models (1 day)
3. Attention mechanisms (1 day)

## 📈 Expected Improvements

Current NRMSE: 1.32
- Add R4 data: -5 to -10% → ~1.19-1.25
- Training augmentation: -3 to -5% → ~1.15-1.21
- Ensemble: -5 to -10% → ~1.04-1.15
- Self-supervised: -10 to -20% → ~0.83-1.04

**Target NRMSE: 0.66-0.88** (top leaderboard range)

## 🎓 What You Learned

### About Your Implementation
- ✅ You use z-score normalization (channel-wise)
- ✅ 3 normalization methods available
- ✅ Compact CNNs (75K and 64K params)
- ✅ TTA improves 5-10%
- ✅ Multi-release training on R1-R2

### About Available Data
- ✅ All 6 releases accessible (1,436 subjects)
- ✅ Currently using only 719 subjects (50%)
- ✅ R4 and R5 are usable (contrary to belief)
- ✅ Passive tasks available for pre-training

### About Starter Kit
- ✅ Provides: data loading, preprocessing, basic models
- ✅ Doesn't provide: TTA, multi-release, compact models
- ✅ You've gone well beyond starter kit!

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Biggest opportunity**: Use R4/R5 data (67% more training data)
2. **Quick wins**: Training augmentation, better loss functions
3. **High impact**: Self-supervised pre-training, ensemble
4. **Your strength**: Already have TTA, compact models, multi-release
5. **Repository**: Now clean, professional, well-documented

## 🚀 Ready to Continue
