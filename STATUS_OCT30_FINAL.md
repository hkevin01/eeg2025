## üî¨ Training Attempts Today

### 1. ‚ùå Aggressive Training (train_c1_aggressive.py)
- **Status**: Completed, WORSE than V8
- **Val Loss**: 0.079508 (+0.24% worse)
- **Issue**: Over-regularization (dropout too high, too strong weight decay)
- **Conclusion**: V8 is already near-optimal for this architecture

### 2. ‚ùå Ensemble v1 (Wrong Architecture)
- **Status**: Stopped - wrong model
- **Issue**: Used 53K params instead of 75K (architecture bug)
- **Val Loss**: 0.160783 (+102% worse!)
- **Root Cause**: Used MaxPool + 96 channels instead of Strided Conv + 128 channels

### 3. ‚ùå Ensemble v2 (Correct Architecture - STOPPED)
- **Status**: Stopped after 2 models
- **Architecture**: ‚úÖ Correct (75K params matching V8)
- **Val Loss**: Seed 42: 0.160783, Seed 123: 0.174294
- **Both 100%+ WORSE than V8!**
- **Issue**: Training is producing dramatically worse results

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Why is retraining producing worse results?

**V8 achieved Val Loss 0.079314 after 11 epochs.**
**Current ensemble training: Val Loss 0.16+ after 7+ epochs.**

**Possible causes:**

1. **Different data preprocessing**: V8 log shows training on same H5 files, but
preprocessing might be different

2. **Initialization luck**: V8 might have gotten a lucky random seed/initialization

3. **Training dynamics**: Something about the original training run (batch order,
augmentation randomness, etc.) led to better convergence

4. **Metric confusion**: V8's "NRMSE" label is misleading - it's actually RMSE,
not RMSE/std. Both metrics show V8 is genuinely better.

5. **Hidden hyperparameter**: There might be a subtle difference in the training
setup we're missing

---

## üìà Key Insight: Metric Clarification

**V8's training log shows "Val NRMSE: 0.160418"**

This is **misleading**! It's actually:
- sqrt(0.079314) = 0.2816 (RMSE)
- The log displays sqrt(MSE), not RMSE/std
- True NRMSE (RMSE/std) = 0.2816 / 0.4007 = **0.703**

The ensemble training is correctly computing NRMSE, showing values around 1.0,
which translates to RMSE ‚âà 0.40, giving MSE ‚âà 0.16.

**V8 is legitimately 2x better in MSE than our retraining attempts.**

## üéØ Recommendations

### Option 1: KEEP V8 ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED**

**Why:**
- V8 score of 1.0002 is **99.98% of perfect (1.0000)**
- Only 0.0002 room for improvement on C1
- All retraining attempts have been worse
- Competition ends soon - don't risk regression

**Action:** Submit V8 as-is

---

### Option 2: Focus on C2 (Not C1)

**Why:**
- C2 has 43x more room for improvement (0.0087 vs 0.0002)
- C2 score 1.0087 ‚Üí target 1.00 = 0.87% improvement possible
- C1 is already near-perfect

**Challenges:**
- C2 requires different approach (classification vs regression)
- Would need to set up eegdash pipeline for proper labels
- Time-consuming (1-3 hours minimum)

---

### Option 3: Try Different Approach for C1

Instead of retraining, could try:

1. **Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)**
   - Average predictions across multiple augmented versions
   - Very low risk, quick to implement
   - Expected improvement: 0.5-2%

2. **Model Ensemble (if we can match V8 performance)**
   - Only if we figure out why retraining is worse
   - Would need to match V8's 0.079314 Val Loss first

3. **Post-processing**
   - Clip predictions to valid range
   - Apply domain knowledge constraints

---

## üöÄ Immediate Action Plan

### RECOMMENDED: Submit V8

**Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ V8 weights already prepared
2. ‚úÖ Submission already packaged: `submissions/phase1_v8/submission_c1_trained_v8.zip`
3. Upload to competition platform
4. Monitor leaderboard

**Risk:** Very low - V8 is proven  
**Expected score:** 1.0061 (current best)

---

### ALTERNATIVE: Quick TTA experiment (15 minutes)

1. Modify V8 submission to use Test-Time Augmentation
2. Average 3-5 predictions per sample
3. Test locally with `scripts/verify_submission.py`
4. If better, submit TTA version; if not, submit V8

## üìã Summary

| Approach | Status | Val Loss | vs V8 | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|----------|-------|----------------|
| V8 Baseline | ‚úÖ Ready | 0.079314 | Baseline | **SUBMIT THIS** |
| Aggressive | ‚ùå Worse | 0.079508 | +0.24% | Discard |
| Ensemble v1 | ‚ùå Wrong | 0.160783 | +102% | Discard |
| Ensemble v2 | ‚ùå Worse | 0.160783 | +102% | Investigate why |
| TTA | ‚≠ï Untested | TBD | TBD | Optional quick test |
| C2 Focus | ‚≠ï Not Started | N/A | N/A | If time allows |

---

## üéØ Bottom Line

**V8 is the winner. Submit it.**

C1 is already at 99.98% of perfect. Further optimization is unlikely to help
and risks making things worse. The smart move is to submit V8 and move on.

If we have extra time, focus on C2 where there's actually room for improvement.
