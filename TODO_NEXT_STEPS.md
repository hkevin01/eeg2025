## 🚀 How to Monitor Training

### Option 1: Check if still running
```bash
ps aux | grep train_challenge2 | grep -v grep
```

### Option 2: View log tail
```bash
tail -100 logs/challenge2_r234_final.log
```

### Option 3: Monitor in real-time
```bash
tail -f logs/challenge2_r234_final.log
```

### Option 4: Watch for completion
```bash
watch -n 10 'tail -20 logs/challenge2_r234_final.log'
```

### What to Look For
```
✅ "Creating windows..." → Data loading phase
✅ "Epoch 1/50..." → Training started
✅ "Best validation NRMSE: X.XXX" → Progress updates
✅ "Training complete!" → Done!

Look for final line:
"Best validation NRMSE: 0.XXX"
```
