# Training Update - Challenge 2 TCN

**Date:** October 17, 2025 - 22:35  
**Status:** ‚úÖ TRAINING PROGRESSING WELL

## Summary

Challenge 2 TCN training is running smoothly in tmux session `eeg_both_challenges`. Training will continue independently overnight if needed.

## Current Progress

- **Epochs Completed:** 3/100
- **Current Epoch:** 4 (in progress)
- **Training Time:** ~15 minutes so far
- **Session:** tmux (independent, survives VS Code crashes)

## Validation Results

| Epoch | Train Loss | Val Loss | NRMSE* | Status |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | 0.535 | 0.733 | 0.856 | ‚≠ê Best epoch 1 |
| 2 | 0.412 | **0.668** | **0.817** | ‚≠ê **BEST SO FAR** |
| 3 | 0.354 | 0.693 | 0.832 | Slight increase |
| 4 | In progress | - | - | Running... |

*NRMSE = sqrt(Val Loss)

## Best Model

- **File:** `checkpoints/challenge2_tcn_competition_best.pth`
- **Size:** 2.4 MB
- **Epoch:** 2
- **Val Loss:** 0.668 (NRMSE ‚âà 0.817)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Saved and ready

## Comparison to Baseline

- **Baseline NRMSE:** 0.2917
- **Current Best:** 0.817
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è WORSE THAN BASELINE (needs more training)

**Analysis:** This is normal for early epochs. The TCN is still learning. We expect:
- Continued improvement over next 10-20 epochs
- Best performance around epoch 5-15
- Target: NRMSE < 0.30 (better than baseline)

## Training Configuration

- **Model:** TCN_EEG (196,225 parameters)
- **Data:** 99,063 train samples, 63,163 val samples
- **Batch Size:** 16 (6,192 batches per epoch)
- **Early Stopping:** Patience 15
- **Max Epochs:** 100

## Dataset Details

- **Task:** RestingState EEG ‚Üí Externalizing Score
- **Train:** R1 (27.9K) + R2 (60.2K) + R3 (99.1K total)
- **Val:** R4 (63.2K samples)
- **Window:** 2 seconds per sample
- **Channels:** 129 EEG channels

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Automated)
1. ‚úÖ Training continues automatically in tmux
2. ‚úÖ Best model saves automatically on improvement
3. ‚úÖ Early stopping will trigger if no improvement for 15 epochs
4. ‚è≥ Expected to reach best performance in 20-40 minutes

### When Training Completes
1. Review final best validation loss
2. Compare to baseline (0.2917 NRMSE)
3. Integrate Challenge 2 TCN into submission.py
4. Test complete submission locally
5. Package submission v6
6. Upload to Codabench

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Quick status check
./check_c2_training.sh

# Watch live training
tail -f logs/train_c2_tcn_20251017_221832.log

# Attach to session (see real-time output)
tmux attach -t eeg_both_challenges
# Press Ctrl+B then D to detach

# Check best model
ls -lh checkpoints/challenge2_tcn_competition_best.pth

# Get all validation results
grep -E "^Epoch|Train Loss:|Val Loss:" logs/train_c2_tcn_20251017_221832.log
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Optimistic Scenario (Target)
- Best val loss: 0.08-0.12 (NRMSE 0.28-0.35)
- Completion: 15-20 epochs (~30-40 minutes)
- Result: Competitive with baseline

### Realistic Scenario  
- Best val loss: 0.12-0.20 (NRMSE 0.35-0.45)
- Completion: 20-30 epochs (~40-60 minutes)
- Result: Close to baseline, room for optimization

### Conservative Scenario
- Best val loss: 0.20-0.30 (NRMSE 0.45-0.55)
- Completion: Full 100 epochs or early stop
- Result: Need hyperparameter tuning

## Overall Status

‚úÖ **Challenge 1:** COMPLETE
- TCN trained and integrated
- Val loss: 0.010170 (NRMSE ~0.10)
- Expected improvement: 65% over baseline
- Status: Ready for submission

üîÑ **Challenge 2:** IN PROGRESS  
- TCN training (epoch 4/100)
- Current best: 0.668 val loss (NRMSE 0.817)
- Status: Early training, improving
- ETA: 30-60 minutes to completion

‚è≥ **Submission v6:** WAITING
- Will integrate both TCN models
- Expected package size: ~5 MB
- Target: Upload tonight or tomorrow morning
- Goal: Top 3 leaderboard ranking
