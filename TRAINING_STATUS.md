# Training Status Report
**Generated:** 2025-10-16 08:42

## üöÄ Current Status: DATA DOWNLOADING

Both training processes are currently running and downloading EEG data from multiple releases.

### Active Processes
- **Challenge 1 (PID 817220)**: Started 08:36, Running for ~6 minutes
- **Challenge 2 (PID 817322)**: Started 08:36, Running for ~6 minutes

### What's Happening Now
1. **Downloading R1-R5 Data** (~30-60 minutes total)
   - Each release contains 60-293 EEG datasets
   - Files are large .bdf format (EEG recordings)
   - Progress: Currently downloading individual subject files

2. **Corrupted File Detection** (‚úÖ FIXED)
   - Scripts now automatically detect and skip corrupted files
   - Multiple corrupted files found and handled gracefully
   - Training continues without crashes

3. **Next Phase: Preprocessing** (after download completes)
   - Window creation from continuous EEG data
   - Trial annotation and filtering
   - Estimated: 10-20 minutes

4. **Final Phase: Training** (after preprocessing)
   - 50 epochs with early stopping
   - Estimated: 12-14 hours (overnight)
   - Will complete tomorrow morning

## üìä Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Crash Prevention
‚úÖ Automatic corrupted file detection
‚úÖ Comprehensive error logging
‚úÖ Graceful error handling with detailed crash logs
‚úÖ Progress tracking every 50 files

### 2. Better Logging
- **Crash logs**: `logs/challenge1_crash_*.log` and `challenge2_crash_*.log`
- **Training logs**: `logs/challenge1_training_v2.log` and `challenge2_training_v2.log`
- **Structured logging** with timestamps and severity levels
- **Full tracebacks** for debugging

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring
**Basic Monitor**: `./monitor_training.sh`
- Simple status display
- Refresh every 30 seconds

**Enhanced Monitor**: `./monitor_training_enhanced.sh` (‚ú® NEW!)
- Color-coded status indicators
- Release-by-release progress tracking
- Corruption statistics
- CPU/Memory usage
- Training epoch tracking
- Auto-detects completion

## üìà Expected Timeline

```
08:36 AM - Training started
08:40 AM - Currently downloading data (YOU ARE HERE)
09:10 AM - Download complete (estimated)
09:30 AM - Preprocessing complete
10:00 PM - Training phase begins
10:00 AM - Training complete (next day, estimated)
```

## üîç How to Monitor Progress

### Option 1: Enhanced Monitor (Recommended)
```bash
./monitor_training_enhanced.sh
```
Shows:
- Real-time progress for both challenges
- Color-coded status
- Release loading progress
- Corrupted file count
- Training epochs (when training starts)

### Option 2: Watch Log Files
```bash
# Challenge 1
tail -f logs/challenge1_training_v2.log

# Challenge 2
tail -f logs/challenge2_training_v2.log

# Both at once
tail -f logs/challenge1_training_v2.log logs/challenge2_training_v2.log
```

### Option 3: Check Process Status
```bash
ps aux | grep train_challenge
```

### Option 4: Check Crash Logs (if problems occur)
```bash
ls -lt logs/*crash*.log | head -2
cat logs/challenge1_crash_*.log
cat logs/challenge2_crash_*.log
```

## üìÅ Data Status

The trainings are downloading data to:
- `data/raw/ds005505-bdf/` (Release 1)
- `data/raw/ds005506-bdf/` (Release 2)
- `data/raw/ds005507-bdf/` (Release 3)
- `data/raw/ds005508-bdf/` (Release 4)
- `data/raw/ds005509-bdf/` (Release 5 - for validation)

**NOT downloaded yet** - trainings are still in progress, downloading files continuously.

## üéØ What Happens When Training Completes

1. **Weight files created**:
   - `weights_challenge_1_multi_release.pt` (~3-5 MB)
   - `weights_challenge_2_multi_release.pt` (~2-4 MB)

2. **Best validation scores logged**:
   - Challenge 1: Target < 0.70 NRMSE
   - Challenge 2: Target < 0.15 NRMSE

3. **Next steps**:
   - Update `submission.py` with new weights
   - Test locally
   - Create submission package
   - Upload to Codabench

## ‚ö° Quick Commands

```bash
# View current status
./monitor_training_enhanced.sh

# Check if still running
ps aux | grep train_challenge

# View latest logs
tail -20 logs/challenge1_training_v2.log
tail -20 logs/challenge2_training_v2.log

# View errors only
grep -i error logs/challenge*_v2.log

# Check data download progress
du -sh data/raw/ds00550*
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Crash Protection Features

### Implemented Safeguards:
1. **Corrupted File Detection**: Tests each file before processing
2. **Graceful Error Handling**: Catches and logs all exceptions
3. **Detailed Crash Logs**: Full tracebacks with timestamps
4. **Progress Checkpoints**: Reports progress every 50 files
5. **Release-level Recovery**: Can resume from partial completion
6. **Memory Monitoring**: Efficient loading prevents OOM crashes
7. **CPU-only Mode**: No CUDA/GPU dependencies that could fail

### Error Types Handled:
- `IndexError`: Corrupted .bdf file structure
- `ValueError`: Invalid data formats
- `OSError`: File system issues
- `RuntimeError`: Processing failures
- `KeyboardInterrupt`: User cancellation (graceful shutdown)

## üìù Notes

- **Training is safe to leave running** - runs in background with `nohup`
- **Logs are preserved** - even if terminal closes
- **Can monitor anytime** - just run monitoring script
- **Auto-detects completion** - monitor shows success/failure
- **Crash logs saved** - detailed debugging if issues occur

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ Running smoothly with crash prevention
**ETA to training phase**: ~30 minutes
**ETA to completion**: ~14 hours (tomorrow 10 AM)
