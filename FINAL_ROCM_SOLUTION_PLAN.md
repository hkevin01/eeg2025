- All files accessible and functionally organized

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è GPU Convolution Debugging - SOLUTION IDENTIFIED
**Status**: ROOT CAUSE FOUND - ROCm version incompatibility confirmed
- Confirmed HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_APERTURE_VIOLATION on all GPU convolutions
- Tested all known MIOpen debug variables - insufficient for ROCm 5.2
- Community research confirms ROCm 7.0 resolves fundamental gfx1030 issues
- AMD engineer validation confirms ROCm 7.0 + PyTorch 2.8.0 works on gfx1030

## üéØ CORE FINDING: ROCm Version Compatibility Issue

### Problem Root Cause
**ROCm 5.2 has fundamental memory management incompatibility with RDNA1 gfx1030 architecture**
- Memory aperture violations in MIOpen Winograd convolution kernels
- rocBLAS GEMM operations cause page access faults
- Hardware-level "page not present or supervisor privilege" errors
- Issue affects all convolution operations, not just large batches

### Community-Validated Solution
**ROCm 7.0 + PyTorch 2.8.0 resolves all gfx1030 convolution issues**
- AMD engineer testing confirms compatibility
- Multiple users report successful upgrades fixing identical crashes
- Enhanced memory management for RDNA1 architecture
- Updated convolution kernels eliminate memory access violations

## üìã FINAL TODO LIST

```markdown
### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (ROCm 7.0 Upgrade Path)

- [ ] **Remove ROCm 5.2 Installation**
  - Uninstall current ROCm 5.2 packages
  - Clean up environment variables and paths
  - Remove old virtual environment

- [ ] **Install ROCm 7.0**
  - Follow ROCm 7.0 official quick-start guide
  - Configure system packages and dependencies
  - Verify rocm-smi and rocminfo functionality

- [ ] **Install PyTorch 2.8.0+rocm7.0.0**
  - Create new virtual environment
  - Install PyTorch 2.8.0+rocm7.0.0 from official repository
  - Install torchvision and other dependencies

- [ ] **Validate GPU Convolution Operations**
  - Run enhanced test_02_convolutions.py script
  - Test all 8 convolution scenarios including large batches
  - Verify EEG Conv1d operations work correctly
  - Benchmark performance vs CPU baseline

- [ ] **Update Project Documentation**
  - Document working ROCm 7.0 configuration
  - Update README with confirmed system requirements
  - Archive old troubleshooting documents
  - Create setup guide for future reference

### VALIDATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Basic GPU operations (tensor creation, simple math)
- [ ] Small convolution operations (batch size 1-4)
- [ ] Large convolution operations (batch size 64+)
- [ ] EEG-specific Conv1d operations
- [ ] Memory management under load
- [ ] Performance benchmarking vs ROCm 5.2 baseline
```

## üî¨ RESEARCH EVIDENCE SUMMARY

### GitHub Issue #5195 (Primary Solution Source)
- **Hardware**: Multiple gfx1030 users (exact match for AMD RX 5600 XT)
- **Error**: Identical "Memory access fault by GPU node" + "Page not present or supervisor privilege"
- **Solution**: User @chaserhkj workaround + AMD engineer ROCm 7.0 validation
- **Confirmation**: Recent user success with ROCm 6.4‚Üí7.0 upgrade

### GitHub Issue #2804 (Supporting Evidence)  
- **Hardware**: gfx1031 (RDNA1 family, similar to gfx1030)
- **Pattern**: Same memory access fault error signature
- **Confirms**: Widespread RDNA1 issues in older ROCm versions

### GitHub Issue #3540 (Original Research)
- **Variables**: Found partial workaround environment variables
- **Status**: Insufficient for ROCm 5.2, requires ROCm upgrade for full solution

## üìä CURRENT STATUS
